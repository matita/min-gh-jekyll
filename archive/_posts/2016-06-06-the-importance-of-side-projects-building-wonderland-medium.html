Alongside our digital projects and achievements, our physical products such as <a href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/" data-href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Cool Club </a>playing cards and Sweaters began as small side projects to explore a completely new area of design for us. We try to keep a red line around all of the things we create and whatever the project, “cool” design has to be within this boundary. We want people to have a real “wow” moment when they see the products we’ve made.</p><p name="d2f9" id="d2f9" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Take <a href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/product/the-cool-club-kaartenspel/" data-href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/product/the-cool-club-kaartenspel/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Cool Club</a>, for example. One Thursday afternoon we sat in our office discussing an innovative way to “market” ourselves, to put our name out there and be recognised for something. The night before I had been having some drinks with a few mates and we had played a card game, which I remember thinking was boring as hell. That night, I thought what if we created a card game that everybody would love, and where the design of each individual card is the main feature. The next day, we brainstormed long and hard — or until our Nespresso pods ran out — and we began thinking of cultural icons that we could add our own Wonderland spin to, by way of some seriously fresh illustration. And just like that, <a href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/" data-href="https://thewonderlandstore.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">The Cool Club</a> was born.</p><p name="b707" id="b707" class="graf--p graf-after--p"><em class="markup--em markup--p-em">The Cool Club is a deck of cards with serious swag garnished with a generous serving of class. From influential thinkers who have helped shape the world we live in, to culturally iconic players of the field — whether it’s football legends or wicked womanisers — these 53 men are heroes. They’re our heroes, and we want to share them with you.</em></p></div><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--outsetColumn"><figure name="f2b4" id="f2b4" class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg" data-width="2048" data-height="1100" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*cBm8IvhXDqbl5TN4TuMxng.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div></figure><figure name="7723" id="7723" class="graf--figure graf--layoutOutsetCenter graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg" data-width="2048" data-height="1100" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/1200/1*T8gTjyv7XGAuBHx3aYbSCg.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><h4 name="b33b" id="b33b" class="graf--h4 graf-after--figure"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">The Psychology</strong></h4><p name="d769" id="d769" class="graf--p graf-after--h4">San Francisco State psychology professor, Dr. Kevin Eschleman, and his colleagues <a href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2014/04/the-positive-effect-of-creative-hobbies-on-performance-at-work.php" data-href="http://www.spring.org.uk/2014/04/the-positive-effect-of-creative-hobbies-on-performance-at-work.php" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">measured the effect of creative hobbies</a> on over 400 employees.

One of which is an internal tool which will be online for everybody to use by the end of October 2016 and the other is an interaction blog, called TOD, which will be online at the end of July. TOD will be a mix all the interactive designs (web/mobile/app) that we find on the web and will act as both a source of inspiration and a platform for the experiments we run within our studio. We can’t spill too much about the other tool right now, but keep your eyes on our Medium blog for any updates and sneak peeks.</p></div></div></section><section name="4d80" class=" section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><h4 name="85f6" id="85f6" class="graf--h4 graf--leading"><strong class="markup--strong markup--h4-strong">End note</strong></h4><p name="a199" id="a199" class="graf--p graf-after--h4">When it comes to our Wonderland side projects, profit is never a thing we dwell too much on.

Well that’s just the icing on the cake.</p><p name="cc0b" id="cc0b" class="graf--p graf-after--p">So far, our side projects have not only boosted our work performance but also the visibility of the Wonderland brand, and this is something you could achieve as well. So, don’t dismiss your side project as just this thing you do, well, on the side. It is the thing you do that makes you happy, it is the thing you do that excites you, and that’s why at Wonderland it’s so engrained in our studio culture.</p><p name="2199" id="2199" class="graf--p graf-after--p">So yeah, side projects matter.
