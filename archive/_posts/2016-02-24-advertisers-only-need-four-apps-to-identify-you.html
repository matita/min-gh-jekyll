						<p>Just a handful of apps installed on your phone can reveal much more about you than you may realize.</p><p>A study from the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation found the majority of mobile phone users can be re-identified in a dataset by as few as four of the apps they had installed on their smartphones, raising privacy concerns as platforms increasingly share app data with advertisers.</p><p>The research, which <a href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.07851v2.pdf" target="_blank">was published</a> in October of last year but has been re-circulating in recent days, analyzed data collected from 54,893 Android users over a period of seven months. The study found that any four apps selected at random can be used to re-identify a user in a dataset more than 95 percent of the time; a full list of installed apps can identify a user 99 percent of the time; and even just two apps could be used to re-identify a user in a dataset with a probability of 0.75.</p><p>A simple list of apps can also show a lot more than just who a user is. In addition to making it possible to re-identify a user in a large data set, a profile of installed apps easily predicts a user’s lifestyle and habits, including traits like religion, relationship status, spoken languages, countries of interest, and whether or not the user is a parent of small children.</p><p>The findings raise privacy concerns as apps like Twitter and Facebook have begun to <a href="http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2014/11/26/twitter-is-tracking-users-installed-apps-for-ad-targeting/" target="_blank">share the profiles of apps</a> used with advertisers and as large data breaches <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/another-day-another-hack-up-to-320000-time-warner-cable-email-passwords" target="_blank">leaking massive troves of user data at once</a> become a growing threat. Researchers in the study found even if the list of apps is pseudo-anonymized, with identifiers like app names removed, easily accessible machine learning techniques can determine user traits and identify a user in a dataset.</p><p>“We believe that this is a real privacy threat to smartphone users (both Android and iOS) today as apps running on these OSs can access the list of installed/running apps,” the researchers wrote. </p><p>They noted that Android apps don’t require any additional permission to access the entire list of installed apps on a device. Although Apple does not allow iOS developers to access all installed apps, a platform can obtain a list of currently running apps at any time and by frequently scanning them quickly generate a list of all installed apps. </p><p>“Since people are unique in many different known and unknown ways, preserving the privacy of mobile users is very challenging,” the study concluded. “New protection measures need to be devised.”</p>					</div>
