<p>Amit Singhal, Google’s SVP for search, is <a href="https://plus.google.com/+AmitSinghal/posts/4PEmsWv8WYe">leaving the company</a> after fifteen years. Singhal has long been in&nbsp;charge of Google's flagship product, and he famously rewrote Google's page ranking algorithm in 2001. He was also a big driver of <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/google-built-and-then-canceled-a-star-trek-communicator-prototype/">Google's&nbsp;<em>Star Trek</em> ambitions</a>.</p>
<p>With Singhal leaving,&nbsp;<a href="http://fortune.com/2015/10/27/john-giannandrea-google-artificial-intelligence/">John Giannandrea</a>, Google's head of artificial intelligence, is taking over the search division.&nbsp;<a href="http://recode.net/2016/02/03/google-search-king-amit-singhal-retiring-artificial-intelligence-research-head-taking-over/">Re/code</a> is reporting that&nbsp;with the change, Google will merge the search and artificial intelligence divisions.&nbsp;Giannandrea previously led the effort to introduce the Knowledge Graph—a machine learning&nbsp;that gives you a direct answer rather than a list of links—to search. Today the Knowledge Graph powers answers to the "OK Google"&nbsp;voice queries&nbsp;that appear on just about every consumer-facing Google OS.</p>
<p>Moving the artificial intelligence unit in with search is certainly an eyebrow-raising move. Machine Learning seems to be taking over all of Google lately. Google Deepmind is building a <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/01/googles-ai-beats-go-champion-will-now-take-on-best-player-in-the-world/">general artificial intelligence</a> that is smart enough to learn and beat various games. It recently <a href="https://www.tensorflow.org/">open sourced TensorFlow</a>, a software library for machine intelligence, and machine learning technology <a href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2015/11/google-inbox-will-reply-to-e-mails-for-you-with-machine-learning/">in&nbsp;Google Inbox</a> can even write short replies to e-mails for you.</p>
<p>After building up Google's biggest product, Singhal says, "I am eager to see what kind of impact I can make philanthropically, and of course, to spend more time with my family."</p>
