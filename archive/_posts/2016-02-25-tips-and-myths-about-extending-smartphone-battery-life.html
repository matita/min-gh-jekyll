Plenty of companies have been developing <a title="New York Times article." href="http://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/03/technology/building-a-better-battery.html">smarter battery technology</a> for years, including methods to increase battery capacity tenfold or charge devices by pulling energy from the air. But lithium ion, the technology that most mainstream batteries are based on, is low cost and easily reproducible while being safe — so we’ll be stuck with it for the foreseeable future, said Charlie Quong, an executive at Mophie, a battery accessory maker, in an interview.</p><figure id="wirecutter-promo" class="interactive interactive-embedded  limit-small layout-small">

In general, lithium ion improves about 10 percent a year in terms of the amount of energy that can be stored in a given space, which is partly why consumers perceive batteries as being far behind other technologies.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="300" data-total-count="2100" itemprop="articleBody">With that backdrop in mind, we teamed up with <a title="The company's website." href="http://thewirecutter.com/">the Wirecutter</a>, a product recommendations website, to run an array of tests to determine best and worst practices for preserving battery life on smartphones. For those who still need extra juice, the Wirecutter also picked some external battery products.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="395" data-total-count="2495" itemprop="articleBody">The results showed that some conventional beliefs about extending battery life — like turning off Wi-Fi or shutting down all your phone’s apps — produced negligible or even harmful results. The Wirecutter also found plenty of helpful practices to get more use out of your battery, like playing music stored directly on the device (instead of streaming it) or tweaking email configurations.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="345" data-total-count="2840" itemprop="articleBody">The Wirecutter tested a range of recent  and Android smartphones with the latest operating systems in tightly controlled environments. Your phone’s results will vary depending on the phone model, cellular carrier, location and other factors, but the general results should hold.

In an hourlong test, an  6s used 54 percent less battery power with the screen brightness at minimum as compared with maximum brightness. An Android test phone used 30 percent less.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="270" data-total-count="3488" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">But it’s tough to use a dim screen in bright environments, so most phones offer an auto-brightness mode that automatically adjusts the screen’s brightness based on ambient light.

Your smartphone can update your email automatically using a technology called push, which brings new messages to your phone the instant they are transmitted. Push can be a power hog because it requires your phone to constantly listen for new messages, so if you get a lot of email, there’s a good chance your phone is using lots of energy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="266" data-total-count="4877" itemprop="articleBody">The Wirecutter tested an iPhone 6s Plus configured with three email accounts, receiving a total of 20 to 30 messages an hour. In these tests, having push active over the course of a day caused Mail to account for 5 to 10 percent of the phone’s overall battery use.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="192" data-total-count="5069" itemprop="articleBody">To save energy, most phones can be configured to instead check for (or “fetch”) emails on a schedule — say, every 30 minutes — or only when you manually tell your email app to refresh.</p><h4 id="subhead-4" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="46" data-total-count="5115" itemprop="articleBody">4.

That’s because the phone uses energy searching for a good signal and, if the signal is very weak, trying to get a better connection.</p>
<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="193" data-total-count="6229" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-10">To conserve battery life, disable the phone’s wireless circuitry.

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="347" data-total-count="10613" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-16">There is plenty of inaccurate conventional wisdom about methods to prolong battery life. Let’s start with one of the worst “tips”: Closing (or force-quitting, as it’s commonly called) apps you are not currently using. The theory is that apps running in the background are using your phone’s components, so quitting them will save energy.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="348" data-total-count="10961" itemprop="articleBody">While that may be true on a computer, smartphones are designed differently: Once an app is no longer in the foreground — meaning you are not actively using it — most or all of its processes are frozen. In other words, while an app may still be loaded in a phone’s memory, it probably is not doing much in the background to drain your battery.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="254" data-total-count="11215" itemprop="articleBody">Finally, quitting apps actually has drawbacks: When you force-quit an app, all of its code can be purged from your phone’s RAM, which means that the next time you open the app, the phone has to reload all of that code. That, of course, requires energy.</p>

<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="442" data-total-count="11710" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-17">A common suggestion for extending battery life is to disable Wi-Fi. However, if you’re in range of a strong Wi-Fi signal, your phone uses less energy to connect to the Internet with a Wi-Fi connection than a cellular one. If you regularly use apps that rely on your location, having Wi-Fi enabled helps your phone determine its location without having to rely solely on power-hungry GPS features, so it actually helps a battery last longer.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="235" data-total-count="11945" itemprop="articleBody">An exception is when you’re at the edges of a Wi-Fi network, where your phone is struggling to get a good connection, <em>and</em> you have a good cellular data connection.

However, the Wirecutter’s testing found this isn’t always the case.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="272" data-total-count="13288" itemprop="articleBody">In testing in a location where both Wi-Fi and cellular LTE signals were strong, an hour of browsing over Wi-Fi used roughly the same amount of battery power as an hour using LTE on an iPhone.

Let Siri and Google listen for your commands.</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="354" data-total-count="13887" itemprop="articleBody">Both iPhones and Android phones include a hands-free feature for summoning their virtual assistants by speaking voice commands. You can just say “Hey Siri” to the iPhone or “O.K. Google” and then speak your request or command. While convenient, this feature requires your phone to constantly listen for that special phrase, which uses some power.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="321" data-total-count="14208" itemprop="articleBody">Yet if you have one of the phones that supports this feature, disabling it won’t conserve much battery life. In the Wirecutter’s testing with an iPhone 6s Plus and a Nexus 6P, there was a negligible difference in battery usage between having the always-on virtual assistant enabled or disabled over a two-hour period.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="276" data-total-count="14484" itemprop="articleBody">Using Siri or O.K. Google uses some energy, so if your phone’s battery is getting low, you should probably stop asking the phone question after question during your commute.

Don’t forgo third-party chargers made by reputable vendors.</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="665" data-total-count="15213" itemprop="articleBody">A common warning around the Internet is that you should use only the charger that came with your phone, otherwise you could damage your phone’s battery. In reality, the phone itself contains all the circuitry responsible for charging its battery. The AC adapter (as it’s more accurately known) simply converts the AC current from a wall outlet into low-voltage, low-amperage DC current that it provides via a USB port. This is why you can also charge your phone using the USB port on a computer, a USB battery pack or a charger in your car — the phone is designed to allow it to charge from a variety of power sources that can produce a wide range of current.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="484" data-total-count="15697" itemprop="articleBody">Finally, you may see warnings that a cheap third-party charger could damage your phone. There’s some truth here: Many chargers — especially budget models sold online, or even at your local shopping mall kiosk — are poorly made, or use low-quality components. A poorly made charger can not only damage your phone, but could also hurt you by exposing you to dangerous currents. So if you’re replacing your phone’s AC adapter, or buying an extra, stick with a reputable vendor.</p><h4 id="subhead-16" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="31" data-total-count="15728" itemprop="articleBody">7.

    	<p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="261" data-total-count="15989" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-18">For many years, devices that used rechargeable batteries required “conditioning” or “calibrating,” a procedure that prevented the battery from forgetting how much capacity it actually had. Today’s smartphone batteries no longer suffer from this issue.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="757" data-total-count="16746" itemprop="articleBody">What can happen, however, is that the phone itself loses track of how much capacity its battery has: Every battery gradually loses capacity over time as you use and recharge it, and the phone’s software isn’t always good at accounting for this capacity change. By periodically (once every couple of months) <a title="Information about battery calibration." href="http://batteryuniversity.com/learn/article/battery_calibration">fully charging the phone and then using it until it dies</a>, your phone’s software will determine the battery’s current capacity and thus let the phone better estimate how long it will last on a charge. In other words, the battery won’t last any longer, but the phone’s battery meter will be more accurate. If you find that your phone claims you have 80 percent of a charge left, but it dies a few hours later, you should try this procedure.</p><h4 id="subhead-17" class="story-subheading story-content" data-para-count="21" data-total-count="16767" itemprop="articleBody">If all else fails …</h4><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="436" data-total-count="17203" itemprop="articleBody">If you have tried all the above and still struggle to get through the day with your battery, consider buying an external battery. These accessories — which can take the form of a bulky case with a built-in battery that you wear on the phone, or a separate battery pack that connects to your phone with a cable — can provide power to last an additional few hours at the end of the day, or even to fully charge your phone’s battery.</p><p class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="477" data-total-count="17680" itemprop="articleBody">The Wirecutter tested more than 100 external batteries for dozens of hours to pick a few favorites.
