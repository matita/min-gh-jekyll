            <section class="post-content">
                <p>While I am no stranger to the magic of <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/css3-flexbox/">Flexbox</a>, I find that I am not using it very often just yet. As a result I end up pausing and referring back to <a href="http://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/">this post at CSS-Tricks</a> whenever an opportunity to utilize its powers presents itself. </p>

<p>I set out to create a <em>quick</em> visual to summarize Flexbox when I run into these moments of pause in the future. I like to think of it as a little diagram (flow chart? decision tree-ish thing?) that is a cheatsheet...based on cheatsheets.</p>

<p>Anyway, I thought I would share it just in case others may find such a resource beneficial as well. You can also take a look at <a href="http://codepen.io/jonitrythall/pen/e706425b447c485247fd31d5378cc32e">the demo I used over at CodePen</a> to practice/tinker your flexible heart out. </p>

<p>If you would prefer to have this guy as a PDF you can <a href="http://jonibologna.com/content/images/flexboxsheet.pdf">grab that here</a>.</p>
