							<p>If there’s a technology out there whose potential is unappreciated right now, it is the potential of blockchain. The blockchain concept has benefits and applications far beyond its original use in Bitcoin.<span id="more-488"></span></p>
<p>I have a confession to make. Despite having a general understanding of Bitcoin, I completely struggled to truly grasp the potential of blockchain systems to be used outside of Bitcoin for much of the initial research into this piece. Its potential was highly touted by Ian Lyons and the team at StartupWeek Sydney who recognised the untapped developer market after their “Let’s Talk Blockchain” panel discussion became one of the most valued of the week. Ian and Michelle sparked my interest, putting me on a quest to find out more about blockchain’s potential!</p>
<h2>What is blockchain?</h2>
<p>Clearly, we cannot go further without explaining what “blockchain” actually is. The simplest explanation is this – it is the technology that underpins Bitcoin. However, for many developers, that explanation isn’t quite enough (it definitely wasn’t for me!).</p>
<p>I’ll start with my own analogy. Imagine you are in a stadium watching a basketball game without any referees or game officials keeping score. Instead, each time a player gets a ball into a basket – every member in the crowd who is within clear eyesight of the basket is surveyed and asked exactly what happened. Their responses are instantly tested for truthfulness and they all tell the exact same thing every time – the ball was thrown into this hoop, at this time, by this player. There is a clear record that this happened which is shared across many sources.</p>
<div id="attachment_506" style="width: 1034px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img src="http://devdiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/basketballblockchain.jpg" alt="My impression of the blockchain" width="1024" height="580" class="size-full wp-image-506"><p class="wp-caption-text">My impression of the blockchain</p></div>
<p>Bitcoin.org defines blockchain as,</p>
<blockquote><p>“The blockchain is a shared public ledger on which the entire Bitcoin network relies. All confirmed transactions are included in the block chain. This way, Bitcoin wallets can calculate their spendable balance and new transactions can be verified to be spending bitcoins that are actually owned by the spender. The integrity and the chronological order of the block chain are enforced with cryptography.”<br>
– <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://bitcoin.org/en/how-it-works', 'Bitcoin.org');" target="_blank">Bitcoin.org</a></p></blockquote>
<p>In an actual blockchain system, the crowd in my basketball example who see each shot go into the basket would be different nodes on a massive networked system. Each node is isolated but can prove their record of the event is correct via cryptography. For fans of the opposing team to try and cheat the system, they would need a majority to enter in the exact same details in every way without being able to coordinate their responses. We no longer need to trust a single group of game officials as we have a more distributed and flawless way to keep score of the game. In the world of blockchain, this means we can have systems of keeping accurate records of events and transactions with no need to rely on banks, governments, big corporations and so on. This provides huge benefits in privacy, security and accuracy.</p>
<h2>Why Blockchain?</h2>
<p>In my efforts researching the blockchain, I spoke with Jonathan Briasco, cofounder of <a href="http://www.vennd.io/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vennd.io/', 'Vennd.io');" target="_blank">Vennd.io</a>, a company that builds enterprise blockchain applications using a RESTful blockchain API (currently in closed beta but soon to be released publicly for developers to use too). He says there is one main benefit to using blockchain technology – the high levels of verification and security.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Blockchain technology obviates the need for large chunks of current security infrastructure by making it impossible to counterfeit data – you can no longer forge signatures, stuff ballot boxes and so on.”<br>
– Jonathan Briasco, Vennd.io</p></blockquote>
<p>The weakest part of blockchain’s otherwise formidable security is the requirement that all users have a private key (an unguessably strong, automatically generated password) for accessing their account. Jonathan points out, <em>“If another person gets their hands on your private key, they have unfettered access to whatever that key secures. This is mostly an engineering problem to get around – what if you lose your key, what if it gets stolen or coerced out of you? And in fact the solution likely already exists in the form of “multisignature”wallets – think of them like 2FA for the blockchain. The real challenge is going to be shifting peoples’ habits to accommodate this new kind of security.”</em></p>
<p>There are benefits in having no need for trust within a blockchain system – it can enable a potential decrease in legal disputes and security issues. All parties can verify transactions, so you no longer need to trust corporations or businesses and thus do not need to rely on laws to keep them in line.</p>
<p>Want another sign that blockchain use is going to explode very soon? Big companies and banks are already onto its potential.</p>
<h2>Big Companies Already See The Potential</h2>
<p>Ian Lyons, digital director of StartupWeek Sydney, made a fascinating observation at their recent <a href="http://www.startupweeksydney.com.au/event/lets-talk-blockchain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.startupweeksydney.com.au/event/lets-talk-blockchain/', 'Let’s Talk Blockchain”');" target="_blank">Let’s Talk Blockchain”</a> event – up to thirty percent of the room were lawyers. Why? In a <a href="http://devdiner.com/interviews/ian-lyons-discusses-the-opportunities-in-emerging-technology" target="_blank">recent interview</a> I had with Ian, he said,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Their clients ask them about blockchain. If they say, <em>“We don’t know”</em> their client goes looking for another law firm.”<br>
– Ian Lyons</p></blockquote>
<p></p><div id="attachment_503" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption alignright"><img class="wp-image-503 size-large" src="http://devdiner.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/blockchainprogram-1024x580.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="363"><p class="wp-caption-text">It is time to start thinking about building with blockchain</p></div><br>
Ian points out that these big clients trust their law firm to understand the regulatory environment and its risks and opportunities. They clearly are looking into this technology in a big way and they are already turning to lawyers for guidance on their strategies.<p></p>
<p>A global partnership of banks under the name “R3” are already testing out various potential blockchain applications which they call <a href="http://r3cev.com/press/2015/9/29/r3s-distributed-ledger-initiative-adds-13-additional-bank-members" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://r3cev.com/press/2015/9/29/r3s-distributed-ledger-initiative-adds-13-additional-bank-members', '“distributed ledger technologies”');" target="_blank">“distributed ledger technologies”</a>. The CIO of one of these banks, the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) <a href="https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/news/media-releases/2015/international-blockchain-workshops-come-to-sydney.html" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.commbank.com.au/about-us/news/media-releases/2015/international-blockchain-workshops-come-to-sydney.html', 'recently said');" target="_blank">recently said</a> that “Blockchain has the potential to transform banking in the way that the internet transformed how we buy music and watch movies.”</p>
<p>CBA, Westpac Banking Corp and ANZ Banking Group are also working with Ripple Labs, a blockchain startup currently focused on “permissioned blockchains”.</p>
<p>In “permissioned blockchains”, organisations invite others to join the system, rather than it being open to all. R3 and other banks appear to prefer this approach, whilst cryptographer Nick Szabo and others in the world of blockchain have been strongly critical of it.</p>
<blockquote><p>“They keep trying to re-inject points of control, and thus points of vulnerability, into blockchains, e.g. through ‘permissioning’; but this nullifies their main benefits, which come from removing points of vulnerability.” – <a href="http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nick-szabo-if-banks-want-benefits-blockchains-they-must-go-permissionless-1518874" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/nick-szabo-if-banks-want-benefits-blockchains-they-must-go-permissionless-1518874', 'Nick Szabo');" target="_blank">Nick Szabo</a></p></blockquote>
<p>CEO of ShapeShift.io, Erik Voorhees, likens the current attempt to silo blockchains into private platforms to the attempts of early Internet companies, AOL and Compuserve, to create walled gardens within the Internet:</p>
<blockquote><p>“Blockchain technology, properly understood, is decentralized. It is an open platform. It does not pass judgement on human actions, it simply enables more action, more easily, to everyone. A blockchain strategy that doesn’t appreciate this is doomed in the same way and for the same reason as AOL and CompuServe. Does industry really need that lesson again?” – <a href="http://moneyandstate.com/its-all-about-the-blockchain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://moneyandstate.com/its-all-about-the-blockchain/', 'Erik Voorhees');" target="_blank">Erik Voorhees</a></p></blockquote>
<p>Governments are also likely to be getting into blockchain technology, <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/world-economic-forum-governments-blockchain/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.coindesk.com/world-economic-forum-governments-blockchain/', 'a World Economic Forum Survey');" target="_blank">a World Economic Forum Survey</a> believed the “tipping point” for government use of the blockchain will occur by 2023.</p>
<p>It is even spreading to the Internet of Things, with IBM partnering with Samsung to work on a <a href="http://www.coindesk.com/ibm-reveals-proof-concept-blockchain-powered-internet-things/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.coindesk.com/ibm-reveals-proof-concept-blockchain-powered-internet-things/', 'decentralised IoT via blockchain technology');" target="_blank">decentralised IoT via blockchain technology</a>.</p>
<h2>Get Involved!</h2>
<p>Developers reading this right now, there is a <strong>massive</strong> opportunity to use blockchain in entirely new and unforeseen ways. Innovation in this area is just waiting for inspired developers and entrepreneurs to use this technology to create the next big Internet product or service. You could create the next Facebook, Amazon, Google, eBay… using blockchain to enable something never thought of before.</p>
<p>The next rather important question then, is how do you get started working with blockchain? Where do you begin with it all? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTXxZdwm93NG_QaKPUrWbQ" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqTXxZdwm93NG_QaKPUrWbQ', 'Chris Mountford');" target="_blank">Chris Mountford</a>, a senior software engineer at Atlassian, specialises in blockchain technology and shared some advice for this article.</p>
<p>Firstly, he recommends using an existing Bitcoin library to interact with the blockchain, there are a bunch of them listed on the Bitcoin website in the section for <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Software#Libraries" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Software#Libraries', 'Bitcoin-related Software Libraries');" target="_blank">Bitcoin-related Software Libraries</a> for a range of different programming languages.</p>
<p>Worried about accidentally losing all your valuable bitcoin? Never fear! There is an alternative blockchain called <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Testnet', '“Testnet”');" target="_blank">“Testnet”</a> which is set up for developers to use when developing blockchain apps. It is not supposed to have any value, so you can play around without fearing the loss of lots of actual funds. However, Jonathan Briasco pointed out that developers should keep in mind that Testnet can be really unstable. Use it for basic tests to ensure your code runs but it isn’t indicative of actual blockchain performance. You’ll want to move beyond Testnet for more extensive testing beyond the basics.</p>
<p>Chris also explained another option, <a href="https://www.ethereum.org/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'https://www.ethereum.org/', 'Ethereum');" target="_blank">Ethereum</a>. <em>“This is a secure, distributed virtual machine that runs on “Ether” – another cryptocurrency. Ethereum is way more general purpose than Bitcoin, which although it is a fairly general purpose technology that can go beyond finance, is still limited by things such as the transaction scripting language not being Turing-complete. Ethereum goes there. Being Turing-complete means Ethereum is a full application platform. Distributed Apps (DApps) can be made that enable P2P decentralised execution of smart contracts and other kinds of software that enables a lot of stuff we probably can’t imagine right now.</em></p>
<p>Jonathan Briasco, co-founder of Vennd.io, also aims to make it easier to get started with blockchain development with their API. It’s currently in closed beta but should be available to the public soon.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Our aim is to open up blockchain development to any web dev who wants to play with it by making it easier to get started. Rather than having to install the client, daemon, all the dependencies, and then download the entire blockchain (which takes hours) you can just get an access key to our API and start building in minutes.” – Jonathan Briasco, Vennd.io</p></blockquote>
<p>Vennd.io’s service will come with a fee, but provides a range of benefits that make it worthwhile. Vennd.io forms a layer of abstraction from the raw client so updates to the blockchain software won’t break your code. You can also code against different blockchains using the same methods, so you can reuse one set of commands to access a range of blockchains. If this sounds perfect for your blockchain ambitions, register to be notified of its launch over at <a href="http://www.vennd.io/" onclick="__gaTracker('send', 'event', 'outbound-article', 'http://www.vennd.io/', 'Vennd.io');" target="_blank">Vennd.io</a>.</p>
<h2>The Potential Opportunities</h2>
<p>If you need a few ideas, both Jonathan and Chris mentioned a range of potential opportunities in the blockchain space.</p>
<p>Chris sees opportunities in <em>“monetizing APIs or existing applications, or making use of the zero barriers to entry to build financial systems such as trading bots without much money or any need for a serious trading account such as is needed to do stock or forex trading”</em>.</p>
<p>Jonathan and Vennd.io see opportunities for blockchain in a range of areas including <em>“loyalty programs and gift cards, financial and commodities markets, document provenance (meaning, proving a document is unchanged from the original – currently a role filled by notary publics), inheritance distribution, voting, identity, title management, even national resource rights.”</em></p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>I think one quote from Jonathan Briasco sums this up better than I possibly could, so I’m going to end with this,</p>
<blockquote><p>“Honestly Bitcoin is probably the least interesting application of blockchain tech. We believe that by getting the devs of the world to solve their problems – and those of their clients – using blockchain, the floodgates are really going to open.” – Jonathan Briasco, Vennd.io</p></blockquote>
