It is in the same “family” as <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" data-href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">React</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" data-href="https://facebook.github.io/flux/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Flux</a>. The best place for an introduction to CSS in JS is in <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js" data-href="https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">this slide deck</a>.</p><p name="2eb6" id="2eb6" class="graf--p graf-after--p">CSS in JS, in a nutshell, is a Node-JS-based CSS build tool, wherein you write your CSS in a <a href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss#example-with-extend-nesting-auto-px" data-href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss#example-with-extend-nesting-auto-px" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">Javascript-like representation of CSS</a>, and the resulting CSS can be output to a stylesheet, or can be inlined for easy use with React components. The most obvious use-case for this technology is for use with React, a JS component rendering library for building “isomorphic” javascript components, with multiple possible outputs (web, native mobile via React Native, web canvas, etc).</p><p name="923e" id="923e" class="graf--p graf-after--p">But it’s not worth going much deeper into the details of this tool here (you’re welcome to explore the link above if you’re interested). Because they don’t matter. What really matters can be found on slide 2 of the deck linked above:</p><figure name="b4fe" id="b4fe" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png" data-width="1001" data-height="748" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="55"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8T5C2Bu2-l4Ppj6NHFFaIw.png"&gt;</noscript></div></div></figure><p name="07dd" id="07dd" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Do you see it? Do you see why the developers at Facebook invented this extreme approach to web development, wherein they tossed out browser-based CSS, one of the simplest and most reliable parts of the web development stack, and even extended the language itself? Let me make it easy for you.</p><blockquote name="5dc9" id="5dc9" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">When I’m saying at scale, it means in a codebase with hundreds of developers that are committing code everyday and where most of them are not front-end developers.</blockquote><p name="3546" id="3546" class="graf--p graf-after--pullquote">Do you have this problem at your company? Are <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">several hundred people </strong>committing CSS to the same project every day. Unless you work at Facebook, Google, or one of <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">literally less than 10 other companies in the world, you absolutely do not have this problem.</strong></p><p name="de48" id="de48" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Now, the enumerated list on that slide is, in fact, an excellent summary of the core problems with CSS. But all languages have problems. One could argue that the problems of languages are like constants in a sea of variables, constants that we learn to live with. And unless you introduce some new variable, one that significantly compounds the effects of the other variables, the problems presented by those constants are livable and workable.</p><p name="d297" id="d297" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">Several hundred people committing to a single project (in this case, facebook.com) is, to put it bluntly, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">fucking bananas.</strong> That is one of those special new variables that, for lack of a better term, fucks all the shits up.</p></div></div></section><section name="2d66" class=" section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="6978" id="6978" class="graf--p graf--first">Of course, there is always more than one reason to do a thing. There is almost never a simple, clean singular reason for doing a thing. The reasoning for creating this particular tool was probably some combination of:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="eaab" id="eaab" class="graf--li graf-after--p">Hundreds of people are writing CSS at Facebook, and these problems are affecting our productivity in a real way. We <em class="markup--em markup--li-em">need </em>something better.</li><li name="e853" id="e853" class="graf--li graf-after--li">React is core to the Facebook business, because it powers nearly all of Facebook web and native mobile. How should styling be done in a unified way on web and mobile?</li><li name="d259" id="d259" class="graf--li graf-after--li">The existing solutions feel old and busted.</li></ol><p name="ab10" id="ab10" class="graf--p graf-after--li"><span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="anon_cb0f2893c22" data-creator-ids="anon">Just because CSS in JS works for Facebook, and <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">they happened to open source it</em>, it doesn’t mean you should use it. Back in the day, General Electric “open-sourced” <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_Sigma" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">six-sigma</a>, but you probably shouldn’t use that bullshit either.</span></p><p name="1a75" id="1a75" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Still, just because this particular solution is a good one for Facebook doesn’t necessarily mean it’s a bad one for your 20 person startup. On principle, that’s true.</p><p name="30b4" id="30b4" class="graf--p graf-after--p">To quote one of the creators of <a href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss" data-href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">JSS</a>:</p><blockquote name="715c" id="715c" class="graf--blockquote graf-after--p">CSS hasn’t been designed to fit into components based architecture.</blockquote><p name="1c04" id="1c04" class="graf--p graf-after--blockquote">Are you writing your entire app in components? Does your startup have such a broad scope in it’s product that you need to? Think for a moment on the vast landscape of functionality that Facebook entails: newsfeed, groups, chat/messenger, advertising, news articles, blogging (facebook notes), events, photos, pages, and more! All of it available on desktop web, mobile, ios and android, powered by the same set of technologies! Amazing! You can start to see why they might need to re-invent how web applications are built.</p><p name="db2f" id="db2f" class="graf--p graf-after--p">CSS in JS represents a fundamental change in how web apps get written — it throws away CSS in favor of a complex Javascript-based build chain that you’d be forced to use to implement CSS in JS. Even better, it actually extends the language. It has vendor lock-in built-in! Joy!</p><p name="50b6" id="50b6" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Is it worth replacing something that is simple, and that virtually everyone either knows how to do, or can learn in a couple of days (CSS), with something that is highly complex, relies on a compiler maintained by a <a href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss/graphs/contributors" data-href="https://github.com/jsstyles/jss/graphs/contributors" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">small group of people</a> (really just one person), and requires re-training yourself, your entire team, and everyone in the future who joins your team? If you’re a consultant, it worth doing this to your clients? Are the benefits that great?</p><p name="d5ca" id="d5ca" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">Do you have several hundred people feeling the pain of CSS development as part of their everyday workflow, and a <a href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB" data-href="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=FB" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">nearly 300 billion dollar business</a> that relies on the software this technology powers? If the answer is no, you really shouldn’t mess with this stuff, because it wasn’t written for you; it was written for them.</p></div></div></section>
