					<div class="pro-tip"><strong>Editor’s note:</strong> This is the second part of a 2-part series. <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/ux-design-tips-for-your-app/">Read the first one here</a>.</div>

<p><span class="dropcap">L</span>et’s continue talking about the user experience in the context of apps. Tips such as making the UX adapt to the user, network-awareness, <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/grow-your-userbase-with-better-onboarding/">onboarding</a>, and other concepts related to the user experience were covered in the first segment of this article series.</p>

<p>Here are a few other UX tips to consider.</p>

<h2>Keep your touch gestures obvious</h2>

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/gestures.png" rel="lightbox[17592]" title="UX design tips for your app, part 2" class="anchorImage cboxElement"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/gestures.png?ver=1" alt="gestures" width="800" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17595"></a>

<p><a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Your+app+shouldn%27t+be+a+gesture-guessing+game%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">Your app shouldn’t be a gesture-guessing game</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a>.</p>

<p>While a few complex interaction options—for example, the augmented pull-to-refresh gesture—can add some real depth to your app for power users, they don’t do much for me during a first-run experience.</p>

<p><a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Feelings+of+confusion+turn+users+off.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">Feelings of confusion turn users off.</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a> If your app doesn’t quickly convey how it can be effectively interfaced with, there’s a good chance I’ll give up on exploring it.</p>

<p>This UX tip is a hard one to show an example for, since you can’t see my hands making user-friendly touch gestures in some app.</p>

<p>So instead I’ll point you towards the <a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/patterns/gestures.html#">Google Material design gesture patterns</a>. You’ll see in Google’s pattern library that there are dozens upon dozens of different gestures listed and indexed—such as the “2-finger double touch”—each with slightly different movements and configuration, There’s no way the majority of app users are keeping up-to-date with all these touch gestures.</p>

<h2>Branding is a part of the UX</h2>

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/blanding.png" rel="lightbox[17592]" title="UX design tips for your app, part 2" class="anchorImage cboxElement"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/blanding.png?ver=1" alt="blanding" width="800" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17596"></a>

<p><a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/brand-voice-and-ux-a-starter-guide/">Creating a brand</a> for your app is about more than picking a cool logo. My phone is awash in a sea of rounded icons with a blue background and a bold, white letter.</p>

<a class="inv-tweet-sa no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Creating+a+brand+for+your+app+is+about+more+than+picking+a+cool+logo.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp">“Creating a brand for your app is about more than picking a cool logo.”<div class="sa-twitter-container"><span class="sa-icon-twitter"></span><span class="sa-icon-twitter-hover"></span></div></a>

<p>Some of my favorite installed apps are hard to pick out of a lineup. When I need to use an app, I should be able to find it quickly. <a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Branding+is+key+to+findability%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">Branding is key to findability</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a>, and thus also to the UX.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<center><video width="360" src="https://cldup.com/f2gBDviYTe.mp4" autoplay="" loop=""><img src="https://cldup.com/GUxuU%C2%ADf2jD.png?ver=1" alt="Your browser doesn't support video"></video></center>

<p><a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/slack-invision/">Slack</a> gained such rapid adoption in a crowded chat space because of the bold colors and fun patterns in its design.</p>

<p>Beyond colors, Slack’s messaging has a tone of serious irreverence that helps it feel like the spunky newcomer it really is.</p>

<p>That’s probably why the company was recently valued at $2.8 billion. There’s a little more to the success than design alone, but that <a href="https://medium.com/@awilkinson/slack-s-2-8-billion-dollar-secret-sauce-5c5ec7117908">secret sauce</a> sure don’t hurt.</p>

<h2>Customer support is also a part of the UX</h2>

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/customer-support.png" rel="lightbox[17592]" title="UX design tips for your app, part 2" class="anchorImage cboxElement"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/customer-support.png?ver=1" alt="customer-support" width="1280" height="600" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17601"></a>

<p>It’s a magical experience when an app is working to its full potential.</p>

<p>But when something goes wrong, we just about pull our hair out.</p>

<p>I’ve developed an amazingly short temper for misbehaving apps. It’s almost like road rage, but for awful apps instead of awful motorists. App rage?</p>

<p>My irrational frustrations escalate when talking about a paid product or service. A paid app doesn’t just have users, it has customers.</p>

<p>If I’m giving you real money, you better be giving me real customer service when things are broken.</p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<p>Sonos makes a line of wi-fi-connected speakers.</p>

<p>As with any network hardware, there might be some issues requiring technical support from time to time.</p>

<p>When something acts up, Sonos makes it easy to submit diagnostics—it’s just a few taps away. This sends Sonos your complete network setup so they can see what’s going on. Each submitted report has a unique ID, which Sonos tracks in a ticket. Accountability!</p>

<a class="inv-tweet-sa no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Customer+support+is+also+a+part+of+UX.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp">“Customer support is also a part of UX.”<div class="sa-twitter-container"><span class="sa-icon-twitter"></span><span class="sa-icon-twitter-hover"></span></div></a>

<p>In the land of nerdy DevOps, submitting diagnostics is commonplace—I’m just happy to see a major app make it this easy when others are going the opposite direction and making it harder to get customer support in order to cut costs.</p>

<p>Bonus: Sonos even responds to support questions on Twitter.</p>

<h2>Don’t forget landscape mode</h2>

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/no-landscape.png" rel="lightbox[17592]" title="UX design tips for your app, part 2" class="anchorImage cboxElement"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/no-landscape.png?ver=1" alt="no-landscape" width="800" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17600"></a>

<p>Some of my favorite apps, many of them worth billions of dollars, are missing a landscape mode. Even if your layout looks super awesome in portrait mode, know this: <a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22it%27s+not+up+to+you+how+your+app%27s+layout+will+be+viewed.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">it’s not up to you how your app’s layout will be viewed.</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a> If the user rotates their device, your layout should follow suit.</p>

<p>More than just being able to rotate the orientation, a solid experience means adapting to any condition your users are in. A smartphone interface scaled up to tablet size doesn’t look good.</p>

<a class="inv-tweet-sa no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22If+the+user+rotates+their+device%2C+your+layout+should+follow+suit.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp">“If the user rotates their device, your layout should follow suit.”<div class="sa-twitter-container"><span class="sa-icon-twitter"></span><span class="sa-icon-twitter-hover"></span></div></a>

<p>From a wrist-top display to a wall-mounted TV, <a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22an+app+should+understand+and+maximize+the+glass+on+top+of+it.%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">an app should understand and maximize the glass on top of it.</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a></p>

<h2>Example</h2>

<center><video width="360" src="https://cldup.com/mQYF6FJVOd.mp4" autoplay="" loop=""><img src="https://cldup.com/19mzDS3fXA.jpg?ver=1" alt="Your browser doesn't support video"></video></center>

<p>Flickr is one of the oldest photo-hosting sites on the web. Lately, they’ve been on an impressive comeback trail.</p>

<p>Flickr gets this simple nod for being one of the few photo social apps that actually lets me rotate when viewing a photo. (Yep. I’m looking at you, Instagram.)</p>

<h2>Multi-device support improves the UX on all gadgets</h2>

<a href="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/device-support.png" rel="lightbox[17592]" title="UX design tips for your app, part 2" class="anchorImage cboxElement"><img src="http://s3.amazonaws.com/blog.invisionapp.com/uploads/2016/01/device-support.png?ver=1" alt="device-support" width="800" height="375" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-17599"></a>

<p>I’ll admit this is a tricky one. Supporting many devices and platforms can be costly.</p>

<p>But, then again, favoring one app platform over another could also be costly.</p>

<p><a class="inv-tweet no-redirect" target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=%22Focusing+on+a+single+platform+leaves+out+a+large+portion+of+potential+users%22+http%3A%2F%2Fblog.invisionapp.com%2Fmore-ux-design-tips%2F+via+%40InVisionApp"><span class="copy">Focusing on a single platform leaves out a large portion of potential users</span><span class="tweet-container"><i class="inline-icon-twitter"></i><i class="inline-icon-twitter-hover"></i></span></a>—and it might even insult and anger some people (Internet folks are weird).</p>

<p>On a <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/small-design-budget/">tight budget</a>, you’ve got to draw the line somewhere. But drawing a line that cuts off half of your potential downloads seems like a rough call. That buzzy app I can’t use? Brand perception suffers as a result.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<center><video width="360" src="https://cldup.com/SDQf7FklM0.mp4" autoplay="" loop=""><img src="https://cldup.com/95LtN5WRh3.png?ver=1" alt="Your browser doesn't support video"></video></center>

<p>Basecamp is a to-do and collaboration app that’s as simple as can be. It works as well on a mobile device as it does via email and a browser.</p>

<p>When it came time for <a href="http://blog.invisionapp.com/native-apps-dont-make-sense/">native apps</a>, they had a trick up their sleeve.</p>

<p>Instead of going fully native, the app used a hybrid webview. Basically, this webview renders the container and navigation with native code, but pulls the content from the web.</p>

<p>They <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3743-hybrid-sweet-spot-native-navigation-web-content">wrote about it at length</a>, because they’re awesome like that.</p>

<p>The hybrid route provided Basecamp users a consistent experience on all platforms with a native flavor, and with a fraction of the development time.</p>

<p>Paprika is my favorite recipe app simply because I can use it just about anywhere. I can load it on any device and my data shows up, so the experience is always familiar regardless of the device I’m currently using.</p>

<p>It might not win any design awards, but I’m including Paprika here to show that an indie team can launch an app on a ton of platforms without going insane.</p>

<p><em>Nook Color?!</em></p>

<p>They put in the time to develop for the Nook Color. What’s your excuse?</p>
