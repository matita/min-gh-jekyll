<p>CSS was designed to be a very simple and intuitive language. Its basic purpose is to define selectors to target HTML elements and apply attributes to them. Easy to grasp and start applying. When working on large and complex projects, though, some CSS features might be a little trickier to deal with.</p>
<p>Its <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Cascade" target="_blank">cascading</a> feature, for example, allows properties to be overridden by other selectors according to its order on the sheet or by <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/CSS/Specificity" target="_blank">selector specificity</a>. Also, elements <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/inheritance" target="_blank">inherit</a> properties from their parents on the DOM. Without proper organization, this can quickly get out of hand and messy. That’s where an architecture comes to help.</p>

<h2>What is a CSS Architecture?</h2>
<p>A CSS architecture brings reasoning to CSS authoring. Imagine it as a set of guidelines and best practices to help developers write&nbsp;code that’s <strong>maintainable</strong>, <strong>flexible to scale</strong> and <strong>more reusable</strong>. We achieve that by <strong>applying a modular approach</strong>, <strong>promoting organization</strong> and <strong>conveying meaning</strong> to our codebase. We’ll see how to apply these principles with 3 basic steps.</p>
<p><strong>Modularity</strong> is a core principle. Not only on a code level, but also on a design one. Digital products have evolved a lot in the past years, due to the rise of new devices and the responsive web. Complexity has changed. We, as developers and designers, have to support this new scenario. Designing pages is no longer the best approach; we should build <a href="http://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/" target="_blank">design systems</a>. Page-based CSS won’t suit our needs on building flexible and scalable products. Working with reusable components is the way to go.</p>
<p>On a CSS architecture, modularity can be applied on several levels. The three basic steps to start structuring your CSS that way are by:</p>
<ol>
<li>breaking the code into smaller chunks and separating them by scope;</li>
<li>coding components in a independent and encapsulated manner;</li>
<li>naming CSS selectors according to their purpose and relationship with each other.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Getting started</h2>
<h3>1. Separate and categorize your code</h3>
<p>To keep the architecture modular, it’s important to break the code into smaller parts. Multiple files make the code easier to read, navigate and track. To do that, a CSS preprocessor – such as <a href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank">Sass</a>, <a href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank">LESS</a> or <a href="http://stylus-lang.com/" target="_blank">Stylus</a> – or a post-processor – such as <a href="http://postcss.org/" target="_blank">PostCSS</a> – is the way to go. Preprocessors enhance the capabilities of CSS authoring, introducing new features such as variables, mixins and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide" target="_blank">much more</a>. To work with separate files, your code will be divided into <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-4" target="_blank">partials</a> and <a href="http://sass-lang.com/guide#topic-5" target="_blank">imported</a> on a <code class=" language-css">main.scss</code> file, that will compile everything into a single <code class=" language-css">.css</code> file.</p>

(Spoiler alert: it’s already categorized :P)</p></div>
<p>Now it’s time to categorize each code block according to its scope on the project. One of the first methodologies out there to introduce selector categorization was <a href="http://www.smacss.com/" target="_blank">SMACSS</a>. The layers proposed by SMACSS are <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>Layout</strong>, <strong>Module</strong>, <strong>State</strong> and <strong>Theme</strong>. <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss" target="_blank">ITCSS</a> expanded this concept, introducing other layers, such as <strong>Settings</strong> and <strong>Trumps</strong>. MVCSS has a similar approach, but with different <a href="http://mvcss.io/manifest/" target="_blank">naming conventions</a>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2443" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2443 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ckl-website-static/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/itcss-layers-e1459171529481.png" alt="ITCSS layer convention. https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss?slide=49" width="500" height="306"><p class="wp-caption-text">ITCSS layer convention.<br> <a href="https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss?slide=49" target="_blank">https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss?slide=49</a></p></div>
<p>You don’t need to follow these methodologies strictly. Learn the examples and figure what better fits your project. In my opinion, separating your architecture into <strong>Settings</strong>, <strong>Base</strong>, <strong>Layout</strong> and <strong>Components</strong> is a good start. <strong>Settings</strong> is where your configuration files, such as variables (colors, sizing, typography definitions…) and helpers (functions, mixins…) will be stored. The <strong>Base</strong> layer will contain your <a href="https://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/" target="_blank">reset</a> and unclassed HTML rules – the way a default <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>a</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> or <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>input</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> should look like, for example. <strong>Layout</strong> stores the structural classes that hold components on the page – grids and containers, for example. And lastly, <strong>Components</strong>: the core of CSS architectures and design systems.</p>
<h3>2. Define your Components</h3>
<p>I consider components the core of a CSS architecture because that’s where most of the code will live. They are the reusable visual patterns that compose a user interface – buttons, accordions or modals, for example.</p>
<div id="attachment_2444" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2444 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ckl-website-static/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/button-component-e1459172905900.png" alt="A button component." width="300" height="85"><p class="wp-caption-text">A button component.</p></div>
<p>Each component should be encapsulated on its own file. For consistency reasons, it’s a good practice to use the same name for the file and main selector.</p>
<div id="attachment_2463" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="size-full wp-image-2463" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ckl-website-static/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/button-scss-file1-e1459172955637.png" alt="A button.scss file." width="650" height="229"><p class="wp-caption-text">A <code class=" language-markup">button.scss</code> file.</p></div>
<p>Some components aren’t as straightforward as a button. Some are more complex, composed of inner elements. Take this blog post component, for example. It has a <strong>thumbnail</strong>, a <strong>title</strong>, an <strong>excerpt</strong> and a <strong>link</strong>.</p>
<div id="attachment_2446" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><img class="wp-image-2446 size-full" src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/ckl-website-static/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/blog-post-e1459171559829.png" alt="A blog post component" width="500" height="539"><p class="wp-caption-text">A blog post component</p></div>
<p>Sometimes, when defining components, you’ll be asking yourself what should be a standalone component or part of a larger block. To answer that, search your product or website for repeating patterns. If it is used on different contexts, abstract it to a standalone component. On the blog post example, the <code class=" language-css">.link</code> element is a separate component, because it is also used on other parts of the website. The other elements are specific to the blog post. Let’s see how to handle this relationship with selector names.</p>
<h3>3. Apply a naming convention</h3>
<p>Remember: we want our architecture to <strong>convey meaning</strong> and <strong>promote organization</strong>. Using a class naming convention in our components will help us achieve that. A pattern such as <a href="http://getbem.com/" target="_blank">BEM</a> (Block, Element, Modifier) will clarify the intention and relationship between a component (the Block) and its elements, as well as reinforce predictability when compared with other components. The idea behind BEM is to name things according to this structure:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Block</strong>: the component itself;</li>
<li><strong>Elements</strong>: the inner parts of the components (descendents on the DOM);</li>
<li><strong>Modifiers</strong>: variations of the block or element.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using the blog post example:</p>
<p><strong>Block</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-css"><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.blog-post</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> … <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p><em>The blog post itself.</em></p>
<p><strong>Element</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-css"><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.blog-post__excerpt</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> … <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p><em>The excerpt inside the promo box. To denote the relation between the Element and the Block, BEM uses two underscores.</em></p>
<p><strong>Modifier</strong></p>
<pre class=" language-css"><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">.blog-post--small</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> … <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p><em>A variation of the promo box that would make it smaller. To denote the relation between the Modifiers and the Block, BEM uses two dashes.</em></p>
<p>On a organizational level, this approach promotes <strong>consistency</strong> and <strong>predictability</strong> across the <strong>Component</strong> layer. On a technical level, it helps decreasing selector specificity, increasing selector efficiency and decoupling our CSS from DOM structure (thus, <strong>promoting reusability</strong>). Take this other example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<pre class=" language-css"><code class=" language-css"><span class="token selector">section.container div.grid div p</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span> … <span class="token punctuation">}</span></code></pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On this scenario, the browser has to check for all the conditions to apply the selector:</p>
<blockquote><p>Is there a <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>p</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> inside a <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> inside another <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>div</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> with a class of <code class=" language-css">.grid</code> inside a <code class=" language-markup"><span class="token tag"><span class="token tag"><span class="token punctuation">&lt;</span>section</span><span class="token punctuation">&gt;</span></span></code> with a class of <code class=" language-css">.container</code>? If so, style this.</p></blockquote>
<p>Complex, right? And a developer that stumble upon that selector might ask himself:</p>
<blockquote><p>What’s the purpose of this selector on a broader scope? How does it relate to other selectors?</p></blockquote>
<p>The BEM class-based approach, on the other hand, is much more precise and meaningful. The browser has only to check for the <code class=" language-css">.promo-box__excerpt</code> class on the DOM, which is more performatic. It can be reused, since it isn’t tightly coupled with DOM structure. And the developer can assume that it is part of a <code class=" language-css">.promo-box</code> component.</p>
