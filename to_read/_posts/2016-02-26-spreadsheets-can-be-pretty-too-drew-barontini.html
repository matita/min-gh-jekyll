 <div class="row mbl--m"> <div class="cell well well--l">  </div> </div> <div class="row"> <div class="cell well"> <p class="post-intro"> Spreadsheets are excellent for presenting information in an easy-to-read format. They allow you to present data, make calculations, and apply conditional formatting. But, if we’re being honest, they <em>sometimes</em> leave much to desire in terms of design. That doesn’t have to be the case, though! Let’s talk about some easy ways to format spreadsheets for maximum pretty. </p> <p class="post-img"><img width="850" height="481" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-01.png"></p> <p>This is our blank canvas to work with. We are using <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">Google Drive</a> to create the spreadsheet, but these principles apply to any spreadsheet. Let’s start cleaning up!</p> <h2 id="delete-excess-rows-and-columns"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#delete-excess-rows-and-columns"><b class="srt">#</b></a>Delete excess rows and columns</h2> <p>The first thing I like to do is set the headers I need, and then delete the excess rows and columns. For this example, let’s create a spreadsheet for our favorite movies. We’ll need headers for the following information:</p> <ul> <li>Title</li> <li>Release Date</li> <li>Rating (1–5 stars)</li> <li>Link (IMDB or elsewhere)</li> </ul> <p class="post-img"><img width="850" height="481" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-02.png"></p> <p class="post-note post-note--unprefixed"> <strong>Tip:</strong> I <em>highly</em> recommend, at this point, to “freeze” the first row (the headers) by selecting the row and going to <code>View &gt; Freeze &gt; 1 Row</code>. Now the headers will stay in place when you scroll, which is useful. </p> <p>And now that we know the number of columns we need, let’s trim the excess. Select columns E-Z, right-click one of the headers, and select <code>Delete Columns E-Z</code>.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="252" height="612" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-03.png"></p> <p>For the excess rows we’ll do the same. We’ll select an arbitrary number of rows for our data and delete the rest. I deleted rows 21–1000 since we can select the <code>Add _ more rows at bottom.</code> (or right-click a row to add one below/above) whenever we need to add more data.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="471" height="728" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-04.png"></p> <p>Alright, we’re looking better!</p> <h2 id="adjust-sizing-of-rows-and-columns"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#adjust-sizing-of-rows-and-columns"><b class="srt">#</b></a>Adjust sizing of rows and columns</h2> <p>So now let’s focus on spacing in the rows and columns. First, let’s select all the rows, right-click any one of the rows, and select <code>Resize rows 1 – 20...</code>.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="514" height="574" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-05.png"></p> <p>Let’s go from <code>21</code> to <code>25</code> to give a small amount of space to each row.</p> <p>Since the column width should vary based on the type of data, let’s use these values to adjust the column width:</p> <ul> <li><code>300</code> for the <code>Title</code></li> <li><code>120</code> for the <code>Release Date</code></li> <li><code>90</code> for the <code>Rating</code></li> <li><code>100</code> for the <code>Link</code></li> </ul> <p class="post-note"> These numbers were discovered after a bit of tinkering. You’ll just have to play with it until it fits the data. </p> <p class="post-img"><img width="660" height="548" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-06.png"></p> <h2 id="text-alignment"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#text-alignment"><b class="srt">#</b></a>Text Alignment</h2> <p>Now let’s center the header text both horizontally and vertically.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="852" height="149" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-07.png"> <img width="900" height="150" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-08.png"> <img width="660" height="198" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-09.png"></p> <p>Nice! A little whitespace and some simple text alignment goes a long way.</p> <h2 id="colors"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#colors"><b class="srt">#</b></a>Colors</h2> <p>Now let’s get to the good stuff — colors! Let’s start with the headers row so that it’s distinguished from the data underneath.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="660" height="98" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-10.png"></p> <p>We’ll use a nice blue background with white, <em>bolded</em> text. This is an effective way to make sure the headers stand out from the content of the spreadsheet.</p> <h2 id="conditional-formatting"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#conditional-formatting"><b class="srt">#</b></a>Conditional Formatting</h2> <p>Another thing that I like to do — when applicable — is to apply formatting based on given conditions of the data. For example, we could highlight a row if it has a five-star rating.</p> <p>First, though, let’s actually add some movies so we have something to work with. To avoid debate about my actual favorite movies, let’s add the top twenty movies from the <a href="http://www.imdb.com/chart/top">IMDB Top 250</a>:</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="660" height="548" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-11.png"></p> <p>Alright, so back to our conditional formatting if a review has five stars.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="342" height="571" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-12.png"> <img width="250" height="498" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-13.png"></p> <p>You can add whatever styling you’d like, but I’m just going to do a “highlight” style.</p> <p class="post-img"><img width="660" height="524" src="http://drewbarontini.com/assets/images/spreadsheets-design-14.png"></p> <h2 id="thats-all-folks"><a class="post-anchor" href="http://drewbarontini.com/articles/spreadsheets-can-be-pretty-too/?utm_source=SitePoint&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=Versioning#thats-all-folks"><b class="srt">#</b></a>That’s All, Folks</h2> <p>And there we have it! With just a few, simple tweaks, we can make a spreadsheet with a much nicer visual design. In the next article, we’re going to get into code and talk about how to consume a Google Drive spreadsheet as JSON. Get ready.</p> <p class="post-note post-note--unprefixed post-note--updated"> <strong>Last updated</strong>: February 24, 2016 </p> </div> </div>
