<p>This is a long-form post breaking down the setup I use to run a SaaS. From load balancing to cron job monitoring to payments and subscriptions. There's a lot of ground to cover, so buckle up!</p><p>As grandiose as the title of this article might sound, I should clarify we’re talking about a low-stress, one-person company that I run from my flat here in Germany. It's fully self-funded, and I like to take things slow. It's probably not what most people imagine when I say "tech startup".</p><p>I wouldn't be able to do this without the vast amount of open-source software and managed services at my disposal. I feel like I’m standing on the shoulders of giants, who did all the hard work before me, and I’m very grateful for that.</p><p>For context, I run a one-man SaaS, and this is a more detailed version of my post on <a href="https://panelbear.com/blog/tech-stack/" rel="noopener">the tech stack</a> I use. Please consider your own circumstances before following my advice, your own context matters when it comes to <a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/blog/tools-of-the-trade/" rel="noopener">technical choices</a>, there's no holy grail.</p><p>I use Kubernetes on AWS, but don’t fall into the trap of thinking you need this. I learned these tools over several years mentored by a very patient team. I'm productive because this is what I know best, and I can focus on shipping stuff instead. Your mileage may vary.</p><p>By the way, I drew inspiration for the format of this post from <a href="https://www.listennotes.com/blog/the-boring-technology-behind-a-one-person-23/" rel="noopener">Wenbin Fang’s blog post</a>. I really enjoyed reading his article, and you might want to check it out too!</p><p>With that said, let's jump right into the tour.</p><h2>A bird’s eye view</h2><p>My infrastructure handles multiple projects at once, but to illustrate things I’ll use my most recent SaaS, a <a href="https://panelbear.com/" rel="noopener">web performance and traffic analytics tool</a>, as a real-world example of this setup in action.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-performance-chart.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-performance-chart.png" alt="Panelbear's performance monitoring feature" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Browser Timings chart in Panelbear, the example project I'll use for this tour.</em></p><p>From a technical point of view, this SaaS processes a large amount of requests per second from anywhere in the world, and stores the data in an efficient format for real time querying.</p><p>Business-wise it's still in its infancy (I launched six months ago), but it has grown rather quickly for my own expectations, especially as I originally built it for myself as a Django app using SQLite on a single tiny VPS. For my goals at the time, it worked just fine and I could have probably pushed that model quite far.</p><p>However, I grew increasingly frustrated having to reimplement a lot of the tooling I was so accustomed to: zero downtime deploys, autoscaling, health checks, automatic DNS / TLS / ingress rules, and so on. Kubernetes spoiled me, I was used to dealing with higher level abstractions, while retaining control and flexibility.</p><p>Fast forward six months, a couple of iterations, and even though my current setup is still a Django monolith, I'm now using Postgres as the app DB, ClickHouse for analytics data, and Redis for caching. I also use Celery for scheduled tasks, and a custom event queue for buffering writes. I run most of these things on a managed Kubernetes cluster (EKS).</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/one-man-saas-architecture.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/one-man-saas-architecture.png" alt="SaaS AWS architecture diagram" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>A high-level overview of the architecture.</em></p><p>It may sound complicated, but it's practically an old-school monolithic architecture running on Kubernetes. Replace Django with Rails or Laravel and you know what I'm talking about. The interesting part is how everything is glued together and automated: autoscaling, ingress, TLS certificates, failover, logging, monitoring, and so on.</p><p>It's worth noting I use this setup across multiple projects, which helps keep my costs down and launch experiments really easily (write a Dockerfile and git push). And since I get asked this a lot: contrary to what you might be thinking, I actually spend very little time managing the infrastructure, usually 0-2 hours per month total. Most of my time is spent developing features, doing customer support, and growing the business.</p><p>That said, these are the tools I’ve been using for several years now and I’m pretty familiar with them. I consider my setup simple for what it’s capable of, but it took many years of production fires at my day job to get here. So I won’t say it’s all sunshine and roses.</p><p>I don't know who said it first, but what I tell my friends is: "Kubernetes makes the simple stuff complex, but it also makes the complex stuff simpler".</p><h2>Automatic DNS, SSL, and Load Balancing</h2><p>Now that you know I have a managed Kubernetes cluster on AWS and I run various projects in it, let's make the first stop of the tour: how to get traffic into the cluster.</p><p>My cluster is in a private network, so you won’t be able to reach it directly from the public internet. There’s a couple of pieces in between that control access and load balance traffic to the cluster.</p><p>Essentially, I have Cloudflare proxying all traffic to an NLB (AWS L4 Network Load Balancer). This Load Balancer is the bridge between the public internet and my private network. Once it receives a request, it forwards it to one of the Kubernetes cluster nodes. These nodes are in private subnets spread across multiple availability zones in AWS. It's all managed by the way, but more on that later.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/cloudflare-aws-ingress-kubernetes.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/cloudflare-aws-ingress-kubernetes.png" alt="SaaS ingress diagram" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Traffic gets cached at the edge, or forwarded to the AWS region where I operate.</em></p><p>"But how does Kubernetes know which service to forward the request to?" - That’s where <a href="https://github.com/kubernetes/ingress-nginx" rel="noopener">ingress-nginx</a> comes in. In short: it's an NGINX cluster managed by Kubernetes, and it's the entrypoint for all traffic inside the cluster.</p><p>NGINX applies rate-limiting and other traffic shaping rules I define before sending the request to the corresponding app container. In Panelbear’s case, the app container is Django being served by <a href="https://www.uvicorn.org/" rel="noopener">Uvicorn</a>.</p><p>It's not much different from a traditional nginx/gunicorn/Django in a VPS approach, with added horizontal scaling benefits and an automated CDN setup. It’s also a “setup once and forget” kind of thing, mostly a few files between Terraform/Kubernetes, and it’s shared by all deployed projects.</p><p>When I deploy a new project, it’s essentially 20 lines of ingress configuration and that’s it:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key">apiVersion</span><span class="token">:</span><span> networking.k8s.io/v1beta1

It’s a little verbose, but it works well in practice.</p><h2>Automated rollouts and rollbacks</h2><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/ci-pipeline.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/ci-pipeline.png" alt="GitOps CI pipeline" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>The chain of actions that occur when I push a new commit.</em></p><p>Whenever I push to master one of my projects, it kicks off a CI pipeline on GitHub Actions. This pipeline runs some codebase checks, end-to-end tests (using Docker compose to setup a complete environment), and once these checks pass it builds a new Docker image that gets pushed to ECR (the Docker registry in AWS).</p><p>As far as the application repo is concerned, a new version of the app has been tested and is ready to be deployed as a Docker image:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code><span>panelbear/panelbear-webserver:6a54bb3</span></code></pre></div><p>"So what happens next? There’s a new Docker image, but no deploy?" - My Kubernetes cluster has a component called <a href="https://fluxcd.io/" rel="noopener">flux</a>. It automatically keeps in sync what is currently running in the cluster and the latest image for my apps.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/flux-autorelease.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/flux-autorelease.png" alt="Fluxcd release commit" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Flux automatically keeps track of new releases in my infrastructure monorepo.</em></p><p>Flux automatically triggers an incremental rollout when there’s a new Docker image available, and keeps record of these actions in an "Infrastructure Monorepo".</p><p>I want version controlled infrastructure, so that whenever I make a new commit on this repo, between Terraform and Kubernetes, they will make the necessary changes on AWS, Cloudflare and the other services to synchronize the state of my repo with what is deployed.</p><p>It’s all version-controlled with a linear history of every deployment made. This means less stuff for me to remember over the years, since I have no magic settings configured via clicky-clicky on some obscure UI.</p><p>Think of this monorepo as deployable documentation, but more on that later.</p><h2>Let it crash</h2><p>A few years ago I used the Actor model of concurrency for various company projects, and fell in love with many of the ideas around its ecosystem. One thing led to another and soon I was reading books about Erlang, and its philosophy around <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4393197/erlangs-let-it-crash-philosophy-applicable-elsewhere" rel="noopener">letting things crash</a>.</p><p>I might be stretching the idea too much, but in Kubernetes I like to think of liveliness probes and automatic restarts as a means to achieve a similar effect.</p><p>From the <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/" rel="noopener">Kubernetes documentation</a>:
“The kubelet uses liveness probes to know when to restart a container. For example, liveness probes could catch a deadlock, where an application is running, but unable to make progress. Restarting a container in such a state can help to make the application more available despite bugs.”</p><p>In practice this has worked pretty well for me. Containers and nodes are meant to come and go, and Kubernetes will gracefully shift the traffic to healthy pods while healing the unhealthy ones (more like killing). Brutal, but effective.</p><h2>Horizontal autoscaling</h2><p>My app containers auto-scale based on CPU/Memory usage. Kubernetes will try to pack as many workloads per node as possible to fully utilize it.</p><p>In case there’s too many Pods per node in the cluster, it will automatically spawn more servers to increase the cluster capacity and ease the load. Similarly, it will scale down when there’s not much going on.</p><p>Here’s what a Horizontal Pod Autoscaler might look like:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key">apiVersion</span><span class="token">:</span><span> autoscaling/v1
</span><span></span><span class="token key">kind</span><span class="token">:</span><span> HorizontalPodAutoscaler

</span><span> </span><span class="token key">maxReplicas</span><span class="token">:</span><span> </span><span class="token">8</span><span>
</span><span> </span><span class="token key">targetCPUUtilizationPercentage</span><span class="token">:</span><span> </span><span class="token">50</span></code></pre></div><p>In this example, it will automatically adjust the number of <code>panelbear-api</code> pods based on the CPU usage, starting at 2 replicas but capping at 8.</p><h2>Static assets cached by CDN</h2><p>When defining the ingress rules for my app, the annotation <code>cloudflare-proxied: "true"</code> is what tells the Kubernetes that I want to use Cloudflare for DNS, and to proxy all requests via it’s CDN and DDoS protection too.</p><p>From then on, it’s pretty easy to make use of it. I just set standard HTTP cache headers in my applications to specify which requests can be cached, and for how long.</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="token"># Cache this response for 5 minutes</span><span>
</span><span>response</span><span class="token">[</span><span class="token">"Cache-Control"</span><span class="token">]</span><span> </span><span class="token">=</span><span> </span><span class="token">"public, max-age=300"</span></code></pre></div><p>Cloudflare will use those response headers to control the caching behavior at the edge servers. It works amazingly well for such a simple setup.</p><p>I use <a href="https://github.com/evansd/whitenoise" rel="noopener">Whitenoise</a> to serve static files directly from my app container. That way I avoid needing to upload static files to Nginx/Cloudfront/S3 on each deployment. It has worked really well so far, and most requests will get cached by the CDN as it gets filled. It's performant, and keeps things simple.</p><p>I also use NextJS for a few static websites, such as the landing page of <a href="http://panelbear.com/" rel="noopener">Panelbear</a>. I could serve it via Cloudfront/S3 or even Netlify or Vercel, but it was easy to just run it as a container in my cluster and let Cloudflare cache the static assets as they are being requested. There’s zero added cost for me to do this, and I can re-use all tooling for deployment, logging and monitoring.</p><h2>Application data caching</h2><p>Besides static file caching, there's also application data caching (eg. results of heavy calculations, Django models, rate-limiting counters, etc...).</p><p>On one hand I leverage an in-memory <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache" rel="noopener">Least Recently Used (LRU) cache</a> to keep frequently accessed objects in memory, and I’d benefit from zero network calls (pure Python, no Redis involved).</p><p>However, most endpoints just use the in-cluster Redis for caching. It's still fast and the cached data can be shared by all Django instances, even after re-deploys, while an in-memory cache would get wiped.</p><p>Here's a real-world example:</p><p>My Pricing Plans are based on analytics events per month. For this some sort of metering is necessary to know how many events have been consumed within the current billing period and enforce limits. However, I don't interrupt the service immediately when a customer crosses the limit. Instead a "Capacity depleted" email is automatically sent, and a grace period is given to the customer before the API starts rejecting new data.</p><p>This is meant to give customers enough time to decide if an upgrade makes sense for them, while ensuring no data is lost. For example during a traffic spike in case their content goes viral or if they're just enjoying the weekend and not checking their emails. If the customer decides to stay in the current plan and not upgrade, there is no penalty and things will go back to normal once usage is back within their plan limits.</p><p>So for this feature I have a function that applies the rules above, which require several calls to the DB and ClickHouse, but get cached 15 minutes to avoid recomputing this on every request. It's good enough and simple. Worth noting: the cache gets invalidated on plan changes, otherwise it might take 15 minutes for an upgrade to take effect.</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="token decorator annotation">@cache</span><span class="token">(</span><span>ttl</span><span class="token">=</span><span class="token">60</span><span> </span><span class="token">*</span><span> </span><span class="token">15</span><span class="token">)</span><span>

</span></code></pre></div><h2>Per endpoint rate-limiting</h2><p>While I enforce global rate limits at the nginx-ingress on Kubernetes, I sometimes want more specific limits on a per endpoint/method basis.</p><p>For that I use the excellent <a href="https://django-ratelimit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/" rel="noopener">Django Ratelimit</a> library to easily declare the limits per Django view. It's configured to use Redis as a backend for keeping track of the clients making the requests to each endpoint (it stores a hash based on the client key, and not the IP).</p><p>For example:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-python"><span class="token">class</span><span> </span><span class="token">MySensitiveActionView</span><span class="token">(</span><span>RatelimitMixin</span><span class="token">,</span><span> LoginRequiredMixin</span><span class="token">)</span><span class="token">:</span><span>

<em>The friendly error message you'd get when being rate-limited.</em></p><h2>App administration</h2><p>Django gives me an admin panel for all my models for free. It’s built-in, and It’s pretty handy for inspecting data for customer support work on the go.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-staff.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-staff.png" alt="Django admin panel" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Django's built-in admin panel is very useful for doing customer support on the go.</em></p><p>I added actions to help me manage things from the UI. Things like blocking access to suspicious accounts, sending out announcement emails, and approving full account deletion requests (first a soft delete, and within 72 hours a full destroy).</p><p>Security-wise: only staff users are able to access the panel (me), and I’m planning to add 2FA for extra security on all accounts.</p><p>Additionally every time a user logs in, I send an automatic security email with details about the new session to the account’s email. Right now I send it on every new login, but I might change it in the future to skip known devices. It’s not a very “MVP feature”, but I care about security and it was not complicated to add. At least I’d be warned if someone logged in to my account.</p><p>Of course, there's a lot more to hardening an application than this, but that's out of the scope of this post.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-security-email.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-security-email.png" alt="Panelbear security email notification" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Example security activity email you might receive when logging in.</em></p><h2>Running scheduled jobs</h2><p>Another interesting use case is that I run a lot of different scheduled jobs as part of my SaaS. These are things like generating daily reports for my customers, calculating usage stats every 15 minutes, sending staff emails (I get a daily email with the most important metrics) and whatnot.</p><p>My setup is actually pretty simple, I just have a few Celery workers and a Celery beat scheduler running in the cluster. They are configured to use Redis as the task queue. It took me an afternoon to set it up once, and luckily I haven’t had any issues so far.</p><p>I want to get notified via SMS/Slack/Email when a scheduled task is not running as expected. For example when the weekly reports task is stuck or significantly delayed. For that I use <a href="https://healthchecks.io/" rel="noopener">Healthchecks.io</a>, but checkout <a href="https://cronitor.io/" rel="noopener">Cronitor</a> and <a href="https://cronhub.io/" rel="noopener">CronHub</a> too, I've been hearing great things about them as well.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-healthchecks-cronjob-monitoring.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-healthchecks-cronjob-monitoring.png" alt="Healthchecks.io cron job monitoring dashboard" width="100%" height="auto"></a>

This is a single setting when creating the Kubernetes cluster, and it's fully managed.</p><p>Operationally what this means is that I write the secrets as environment variables in a Kubernetes manifest, I then run a command to encrypt them before committing, and push my changes.</p><p>The secrets are deployed within a few seconds, and the cluster will take care of automatically decrypting them before running my containers.</p><h2>Relational data: Postgres</h2><p>For experiments I run a vanilla Postgres container within the cluster, and a Kubernetes cronjob that does daily backups to S3. This helps keep my costs down, and it’s pretty simple for just starting out.</p><p>However, as a project grows, like Panelbear, I move the database out of the cluster into RDS, and let AWS take care of encrypted backups, security updates and all the other stuff that’s no fun to mess up.</p><p>For added security, the databases managed by AWS are still deployed within my private network, so they’re unreachable via the public internet.</p><h2>Columnar data: ClickHouse</h2><p>I rely on <a href="https://clickhouse.tech/" rel="noopener">ClickHouse</a> for efficient storage and (soft) real-time queries over the analytics data in Panelbear. It’s a fantastic columnar database, incredibly fast and when you structure your data well you can achieve high compression ratios (less storage costs = higher margins).</p><p>I currently self-host a ClickHouse instance within my Kubernetes cluster. I use a StatefulSet with encrypted volume keys managed by AWS. I have a Kubernetes CronJob that periodically backups up all data in an efficient columnar format to S3. In case of disaster recovery, I have a couple of scripts to manually backup and restore the data from S3.</p><p>ClickHouse has been rock-solid so far, and it’s an impressive piece of software. It’s the only tool I wasn’t already familiar with when I started my SaaS, but thanks to their docs I was able to get up and running pretty quickly.</p><p>I think there’s a lot of low hanging fruit in case I wanted to squeeze out even more performance (eg. optimizing the field types for better compression, pre-computing materialized tables and tuning the instance type), but it’s good enough for now.</p><h2>DNS-based service discovery</h2><p>Besides Django, I also run containers for Redis, ClickHouse, NextJS, among other things. These containers have to talk to each other somehow, and that somehow is via the built-in service discovery in Kubernetes.</p><p>It’s pretty simple: I define a Service resource for the container and Kubernetes automatically manages DNS records within the cluster to route traffic to the corresponding service.</p><p>For example, given a Redis service exposed within the cluster:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-yaml"><span class="token key">apiVersion</span><span class="token">:</span><span> v1

I have split them into two directories: <code>cluster</code> and <code>apps</code>.</p><p>Inside the <code>cluster</code> directory I describe all cluster-wide services and configuration, things like the nginx-ingress, encrypted secrets, prometheus scrapers, and so on. Essentially the reusable bits.</p><p>On the other hand, the <code>apps</code> directory contains one namespace per project, describing what is needed to deploy it (ingress rules, deployments, secrets, volumes, and so on).</p><p>One of the cool things about Kubernetes, is that you can customize almost everything about your stack.

The current plan for a given customer is a column called <code>plan_code</code> on a <code>BillingProfile</code> model. I separate the user from the billing information since I'm planning to add organizations/teams at some point, and that way I can easily migrate the BillingProfile to the account owner / admin user.</p><p>Of course this model won't scale if you're offering thousands of individual products in an e-commerce shop, but it works pretty well for me since a SaaS usually only has a few plans.</p><h2>Logging</h2><p>I don’t need to instrument my code with any logging agent or anything like that. I simply log to stdout and Kubernetes automatically collects, and rotates logs for me. I could also automatically ship those logs to something like Elasticsearch/Kibana using <a href="https://fluentbit.io/" rel="noopener">FluentBit</a>, but I don’t do that yet to keep things simple.</p><p>To inspect the logs I use <a href="https://github.com/wercker/stern" rel="noopener">stern</a>, a tiny CLI tool for Kubernetes that makes it super easy to tail application logs across multiple pods.
For example, <code>stern -n ingress-nginx</code> would tail the access logs for my nginx pods even across multiple nodes.</p><h2>Monitoring and alerting</h2><p>In the beginning I used a self-hosted Prometheus / Grafana to automatically monitor my cluster and application metrics. However, I didn’t feel comfortable self-hosting my monitoring stack, because if something went wrong in the cluster, my alerting system would go down with it too (not great).</p><p>If there’s one thing that should never go down is your monitoring system, otherwise you’re essentially flying without instruments. That’s why I swapped my monitoring / alerting system with a hosted service (<a href="https://newrelic.com/" rel="noopener">New Relic</a>).</p><p>All my services have a Prometheus integration that automatically records and forwards the metrics to a compatible backend, such as Datadog, New Relic, Grafana Cloud or a self-hosted Prometheus instance (what I used to do). To migrate to New Relic, all I had to do was to use their Prometheus Docker image, and shutdown the self-hosted monitoring stack.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-newrelic-monitoring.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-newrelic-monitoring.png" alt="Panelbear New Relic Dashboard" width="100%" height="auto"></a>

<em>The metric automatically shows up in New Relic thanks to the Prometheus integration.</em></p><h2>Error tracking</h2><p>Everyone thinks they don’t have errors in their application, until they start error tracking. It’s too easy for an exception to get lost in logs, or worse you’re aware of it but unable to reproduce the problem due to lack of context.</p><p>I use <a href="https://sentry.io/" rel="noopener">Sentry</a> to aggregate and notify me about errors across my applications. Instrumenting my Django apps is very simple:</p><div class="code-block text-sm"><pre><code class="language-python"><span>SENTRY_DSN </span><span class="token">=</span><span> env</span><span class="token">.</span><span class="token">str</span><span class="token">(</span><span class="token">"SENTRY_DSN"</span><span class="token">,</span><span> default</span><span class="token">=</span><span class="token">None</span><span class="token">)</span><span>

<em>Sentry aggregates and notifies me in case of exceptions.</em></p><p>I use a Slack <code>#alerts</code> channel to centralize all my alerts: downtime, cron job failures, security alerts, performance regressions, application exceptions, and whatnot. It's great because I can often correlate issues when multiple services ping me around the same time, on seemingly unrelated problems.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-slack-alerts-channel.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-slack-alerts-channel.png" alt="Panelbear Slack alerts channel" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Example Slack alert due to a CDN endpoint being down in Sydney, Australia.</em></p><h2>Profiling and other goodies</h2><p>When I need to deep dive, I also use tools like <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html" rel="noopener">cProfile</a> and <a href="https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/" rel="noopener">snakeviz</a> to better understand allocations, number of calls and other stats about my app’s performance. Sounds fancy but they’re pretty easy to use tools, and have helped me identify various issues in the past that made my dashboards slow from seemingly unrelated code.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-cprofile-snakeviz.jpeg" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-cprofile-snakeviz.jpeg" alt="Panelbear New Relic Uptime Monitoring" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>cProfile and snakeviz are great tools to profile your Python code locally.</em></p><p>I also use the <a href="https://django-debug-toolbar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" rel="noopener">Django debug toolbar</a> on my local machine to easily inspect the queries that a view triggers, preview outgoing emails during development, and many other goodies.</p><p><a href="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-django-debug-toolbar.png" class="image-wrapper"><img src="https://anthonynsimon.com/img/content/panelbear-django-debug-toolbar.png" alt="Panelbear New Relic Uptime Monitoring" width="100%" height="auto"></a>
<em>Django's Debug Toolbar is great for inspecting stuff in local dev, and previewing transactional emails.</em></p><h2>That's all folks</h2><p>I hope you enjoyed this post if you've made it this far. It ended up being a lot longer than I originally intended as there was a lot of ground to cover.</p><p>If you're not already familiar with these tools consider using a managed platform first, for example <a href="https://render.com/" rel="noopener">Render</a> or DigitalOcean's <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/" rel="noopener">App Platform</a> (not affiliated, just heard great things about both). They will help you focus on your product, and still gain many of the benefits I talk about here.</p><p>"Do you use Kubernetes for everything?" - No, different projects, different needs. For example this blog is hosted on <a href="https://vercel.com/" rel="noopener">Vercel</a>.</p><p>That said, I do intend to write more follow up posts on specific tips and tricks, and share more lessons learned along the way. Especially on running a business as an engineer, as I still have lots to learn.</p>
