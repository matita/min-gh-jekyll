        <h2>Self-Promotion For The Introverted Freelancer</h2>
        <p>Once upon a time, in a magical kingdom, introverted creative freelancers lived and worked in peace.</p>
<p>Clients communicated their projects by email once a month, with a mid-month review, and otherwise the kingdom was silent (save for the sound of keyboards and mouse clicks).</p>
<p>The citizens were happy and well-fed. Everything was coming up Sketch. And then…</p>
<p>Snapchat invaded. And LinkedIn! And Instagram! And Behance! And Dribbble! And personal websites! And blogs! And vlogs!</p>
<p>The period of peace was over. The Internet had begun to wage its war.</p>
<p><strong><span class="sumo_twilighter_highlighted twilighter-722ab2e5">No matter what you do, marketing is as integral to your business as whatever your skill is.<span class="sumo_twilighter_shares">1</span></span> </strong>But it doesn’t have to be sleazy.</p>
<h3>What we’re talking about when we talk about self-promotion</h3>
<p>If we’re talking marketing for freelancers, we’re talking the&nbsp;<em>Know-Like-Trust theory.</em></p>
<p>For an in-depth explanation of KLT, <a href="http://thenuschool.com/marketing-creatives-101/">click here</a>.</p>
<p>Brief rundown: In order for clients to hire you for their projects, they have to&nbsp;<strong>know, like, </strong>and<strong> trust</strong> you. In order to make that happen, you have to cultivate a relationship with them that is friendly, giving, valuable, and human.</p>
<p>So, when it comes to self-promotion, we’re talking about creating an image that is all of those things: friendly, giving, valuable, and human. You are an expert, but also a fun person to be around.</p>
<p>It’s why people&nbsp;actually care about whether or not they’d want to have a beer with POTUS. Marketing.</p>
<h3>The way it works</h3>
<p>The way you know your marketing is working is if more people are able to find you and pay you to do things.</p>
<p>Some will say the way to do that is to be everywhere. Have your face on every network. Make a lot of Internet friends. Use social media less for social, more as a PR tool.</p>
<p><strong>There’s another option,&nbsp;though.</strong></p>
<p>Back off from all of those tools and re-think your goals.</p>
<p>You want people to 1. know, 2. like, 3. trust you. But who are those people?</p>
<p>Once you know exactly who they are, you can start working on a marketing strategy addressing them that doesn’t put weird animal filters on your face (wtf Snapchat, what’s the deal?)</p>
<h3>The part that feels weird</h3>
<p>“To feel right at the end, you have to feel a little weird at the beginning.” – Me</p>
<p>Marketing isn’t guessing. It’s based on strategy and analysis.</p>
<p>Once you’ve identified your target market, you can begin to develop a strategy for reaching them. Where do they hang out? Do they have meetups? Do they have Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter/social in general groups?</p>
<p>Where do they hang out? Do they have meetups? What blogs do they read? Do they have Facebook/LinkedIn/Twitter/social in general groups?</p>
<p>Put yourself in the position of one of your clients. What is a need they have that’s been unaddressed?</p>
<p>Learn everything you can about them. Who are the active players, and what do they talk about? What are they missing?</p>
<p>PS. Don’t be afraid to actually ask one of them about this.</p>
<h3>The part that feels right</h3>
<p>The reason you did this research is because, <strong>to quietly self-promote, you want to help.</strong></p>
<p>A great way to do this is by facilitating communities.</p>
<p>By giving your clients a space to learn, talk, vent, and share, you’ll not only be the first one to hear their news and grievances, but you’ll also be seen as an expert — without needing to spend a second in front of the camera.</p>
<p>You know your people best, but I have some suggestions. They all take effort, but it’s worthwhile.</p>
<p><strong>Open a Facebook/LinkedIn group</strong></p>
<p>If you have enough people in mind to facilitate real conversations (50+ at least), open a group.</p>
<p>By posting articles/job openings,&nbsp;asking questions, opening discussion boards, and sharing content, you’ll be engaging your people without talking about yourself.</p>
<p>Eventually, the goal is for discussion in the group to be self-sustaining without your facilitation, so you can participate without always having to make the first move.</p>
<p><strong>Start an email digest</strong></p>
<p>By starting to work with curation, not only will you be in daily/weekly contact with people in your community, but you’ll also be HQ for your industry’s hottest news.</p>
<p>Depending on how popping your industry is, sending out a daily/weekly/as frequent as you want digest of the most resourceful/controversial/helpful articles in your community.</p>
<p>Not only are you helping your clients identify trends and stay up-to-date, you’re also helping reporters find and target communities.</p>
<p><strong>Get active on Reddit</strong></p>
<p>This has the least immediate payoff, but is also the most anonymous.</p>
<p>By being active within your industry’s communities on Reddit, you’ll be growing your knowledge base and underground network.</p>
<p>The only problem is, it’s super frowned upon to give out your identity on Reddit. It’s ground zero for self-promotion-haters.</p>
<p>Solution: Private messaging. Start to make friendships with posters, and once you’re comfortable with them, you can swap identities.</p>
<h3>The future</h3>
<p>Marketing is about getting people to come to you before you have to come to them.</p>
<p>Having communities of people who rely on me is an amazing way to have potential clients rely on you for knowledge without talking about yourself all the time.</p>
<p>Once you provide a helpful resource, clients will trust you — and you’ll be fully booked all the time.</p>
<h3>So, bottom line: Is it possible to&nbsp;promote your work while staying in your comfort zone?</h3>
<p>With a bit of flexibility, yes.</p>
