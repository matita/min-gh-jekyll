            <p><strong>The $9.99 per month service is&nbsp;now available&nbsp;in the&nbsp;USA.</strong></p>
<p>SoundCloud has finally launched&nbsp;its long-awaited subscription service.</p>
<p>Called&nbsp;<a href="https://soundcloud.com/go" target="_blank"><strong>SoundCloud Go</strong></a>, the service is currently only available in the US, and offers an expanded catalogue of tracks provided by UMG, Sony, Warner and Merlin alongside the platform’s user-created content for $9.99 per month.</p>
<p>SoundCloud <a href="https://blog.soundcloud.com/2016/03/29/introducing-soundcloud-go/" target="_blank"><strong>promises</strong></a> that the service will offer “even more tracks from emerging and established creators” including mainstream and underground sounds alongside podcasts, the ability to listen offline and an ad-free experience.</p>
<p>Creators&nbsp;who already pay for SoundCloud’s Pro Unlimited service will be able to subscribe for a reduced price of $4.99 per month. iOS users who subscribe through the app will have to pay $12.99 per month.</p>
<p>SoundCloud’s <a href="http://www.factmag.com/2016/03/18/soundcloud-sony-music-licensing-deal-reached/" target="_blank"><strong>recent deals</strong></a> with all three major labels has meant the company is&nbsp;clear to launch its subscription service, which has been in the pipeline for over a year.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="http://musically.com/2016/03/29/soundcloud-go-paid-subscription-service-launches-in-the-us/" target="_blank"><em><strong>Music Ally</strong></em></a>, SoundCloud co-founder&nbsp;Eric Wahlforss said: “We now have all the music industry essentially agreed on deals that we’ve been working on for quite some time. We have Sony, Universal, Warner, Merlin and numerous smaller labels. And we also have all of the publishers that matter in the US agreed.”</p>
<p>“These deals are very special: they’re bespoke in nature, and allow us to do some pretty cool things.”</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;Wahlforss, the complication of making licensing deals with different territories has prevented the service from launching globally to begin with, but he promised SoundCloud Go will&nbsp;launch in “multiple countries” in 2016.</p>
