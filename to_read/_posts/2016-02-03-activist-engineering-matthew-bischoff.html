  <h1 class="post-title">Activist Engineering</h1>
  <time datetime="2016-02-02T00:00:00+00:00" class="post-date">02 February 2016</time>
  <p>You’ve been there. You’re sitting in a meeting and your boss, a product manager, or an executive is talking about Q2 goals. They’re laying out a roadmap of the features that are going to be “coming down the pike”. All of a sudden you see it. An innocuous bullet that makes your blood boil: “<a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/4/30/4286090/path-is-spamming-address-books-with-unwanted-texts-and-robocalls">Auto-invite friends</a>”, “<a href="https://marco.org/2014/12/01/app-store-rule-5-6">Re-engagement notifications</a>”, or “<a href="https://www.dzombak.com/blog/2015/09/Nobody-is-using-App-Transport-Security--what-s-next-.html">Disable ATS</a>”.</p>

<p>The particular feature isn’t important. What matters is that you’re the engineer that’s noticed this capital-B <em>Bad Idea</em>. You know why it’s a problem. This time it’s not just the technical debt or the time it’d take to implement. This idea is bad because it trades a worse product for a better “business”: revenue, eyeballs, impressions, you know the drill.</p>

<p><strong>You have a choice in this moment</strong>. You can stay quiet and hope it goes away or point it out, question it, and even argue against it. But so often, engineers fold. They ignore their conscience and their gut in the interest of a steady paycheck and an easier work day. Avoid conflict at all costs, especially when that cost could be their job. “Just keep your head down and do what you’re told”, they think, while they twiddle their thumbs as bad product decisions whoosh by. Sure, they complain about it over drinks with coworkers and in one-on-ones, but they don’t say anything when it counts.</p>

<p>We’re better than this. As software engineers <a href="https://vimeo.com/68470326">and designers</a>, we’re in the room when decisions are shaped, and the <em>only</em> ones who have the power to actually execute them. It’s our responsibility not to forsake the people who trust the apps we make with our silence. To stand up and refuse to implement unethical systems and <a href="http://darkpatterns.org/">dark patterns</a>. And even more, to educate stakeholders on the real human costs of their business decisions: the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOgHE5nEq04">time, attention</a>, money, and trust of their customers.</p>

<p>It’s harder, yes, and riskier. But <strong>they can’t build it without us</strong>. We get a say. Even if it’s not in that meeting, we can think about the goals they’re trying to accomplish and propose alternatives. We don’t have to hide in our sit-stand nap pods and eye-roll while we engineer a worse world. We can do more than write code. We can research and present better alternatives. We can write memos and make a slide decks to convince them of of our position. We can be <em>activist engineers</em>.</p>

<p>Even though these bad ideas may buttress the metric-of-the-week, they’re at the direct expense of consumer trust and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_satisfaction">customer satisfaction</a>. They’re a tax on our company’s reputation. We have to push the people making the decisions to measure more than just the number they’re trying to increase. Look at reviews, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter">net promoter score</a>, social media mentions, and team morale. All of these trends matter to the long-term health of the company, and should be treated as such.</p>

<p>This requires long-term thinking and the kind of organization that’s receptive to it. In many companies, quantifiable short term gains are valued more than long-term, qualitative investment. The best companies resist this temptation to make a quick buck and build upon a lasting mission and principles. But even in companies with lofty vision statements, things can go awry. A bad quarter can send the company’s hard-won principles out the window to make room for the growth hackers.</p>

<p>In other disciplines, engineers wear an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineer%27s_Ring">iron ring</a> to remind them of their commitment to their profession. Though we may not be part of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_the_Engineer">Order of the Engineer</a>, we can learn a lot from their obligation:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><em>As an engineer, I shall participate in none but honest enterprises. When needed, my skill and knowledge shall be given without reservation for the public good. In the performance of duty, and in fidelity to my profession, I shall give the utmost</em>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, not every idea you dislike is a bad one, so spend your reputation thoughtfully but forcefully. Make your dissent count, but <a href="https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_jerk">don’t be a jerk</a>.</p>

<p>Our job as software engineers is to build things that make the world (or a corner of it) better, things that solve problems. But that’s not our only job. It’s also to be gatekeepers: to prevent ideas that we know are harmful from being realized. What’s the worst that could happen: we get a reputation for giving a damn?</p>
