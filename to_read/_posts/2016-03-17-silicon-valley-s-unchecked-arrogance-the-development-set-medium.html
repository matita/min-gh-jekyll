Brilliant people have created transformative companies — and have earned a great living in the process. Facebook and Twitter have given people the ability to express themselves in authoritarian governments; the inventors of the mobile phones have brought information and services to billions; and Google makes the world’s information available to everyone.</p><blockquote name="648f" id="648f" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">But Silicon Valley’s view towards the rest of the world is often one of unchecked arrogance.</blockquote><p name="0be5" id="0be5" class="graf--p graf-after--pullquote">In the universal basic income proposal, the Y-Combinator team posits that Silicon Valley’s wonderful creations will create an incredible amount of wealth, but <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html" data-href="http://www.paulgraham.com/ineq.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">will put</a> a lot of people out of work. Silicon Valley frequently worries, for example, that if self-driving cars are commercialized, truck and taxi drivers will be out of work. As such, a universal basic income will ensure that <a href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/basic-income" data-href="https://blog.ycombinator.com/basic-income" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">they’ll be happy and society will be successful</a>. It’s a seductive idea, but they are asking the wrong questions.</p><p name="f885" id="f885" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The idea here is borne from an underlying assumption that capitalism has winners and losers, and the victors have a responsibility to take care of the rest. Instead, we’d posit that many of the “winners” in Silicon Valley are part of a faux meritocracy — being born into the right city or social network.</p><p name="33be" id="33be" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Silicon Valley seems to be worried that the rest of the world won’t find its way. A recent podcast from venture firm Andreessen Horowitz described how a few “Alpha Cities” are going to drive the future, while other metropolises will struggle to find their meaning. When India didn’t go for a Silicon Valley-led internet proposal, <a href="https://medium.com/u/fa65e64cf273" data-href="https://medium.com/u/fa65e64cf273" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="fa65e64cf273" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user">Marc Andreessen</a> gained global denunciation (including from Silicon Valley CEOs such as Mark Zuckerberg) for a tweet that said, “Anti-colonialism has been economically catastrophic for the Indian people for decades. Why stop now?” And Y-Combinator themselves say that for startups to be successful, they have to move to Silicon Valley. “We would not be doing a startup a favor by not making them move,” their website reads.</p><blockquote name="a46a" id="a46a" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf-after--p">So Silicon Valley, in its own mind, creates the future, while the rest of the world (by virtue of zip code or differing world view) should follow suit or risk being left behind.</blockquote><p name="2c56" id="2c56" class="graf--p graf-after--pullquote">One could take this to its logical (and cynical) conclusion and say that the rest of the world will eventually be out of work and become a burden on the enlightened few. They’ll storm the gates of Silicon Valley’s kingdom, and the resulting social unrest will be an unfortunate distraction to the wonders of artificial intelligence, research into extending life past the age of 120, and other great wonders of modern technology.</p><p name="0ae4" id="0ae4" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The universal basic income will keep “these people” at bay.</p></div><div class="section-inner u-sizeFullWidth"><figure name="88ff" id="88ff" class="graf--figure graf--layoutFillWidth graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*vzCzj4CF8BZQk2bmg4rsQg.png" data-width="2000" data-height="1600" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*vzCzj4CF8BZQk2bmg4rsQg.png?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/2000/1*vzCzj4CF8BZQk2bmg4rsQg.png" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/2000/1*vzCzj4CF8BZQk2bmg4rsQg.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/2000/1*vzCzj4CF8BZQk2bmg4rsQg.png"&gt;</noscript></div></div></figure></div><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="9919" id="9919" class="graf--p graf--hasDropCapModel graf--hasDropCap graf-after--figure"><span class="graf-dropCap">Y</span><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Combinator and their Silicon Valley counterparts</strong> often talk about the value of geography.

In a <a href="https://soundcloud.com/venturedpodcast/bill_campbell" data-href="https://soundcloud.com/venturedpodcast/bill_campbell" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">recent podcast</a> with Kleiner Perkins partner Randy Komisar and legendary Silicon Valley “coach” Bill Campbell — mentor to Steve Jobs and Larry Page — Randy asked whether, over time, entrepreneurs were solving increasingly frivolous problems.

Uber’s great at solving how people with smartphones and disposable income can get around major cities — a small fraction of the global population. Uber is less good at helping the drivers, whose income is much lower than the riders, benefit from this new paradigm. Uber has hailed their impact as letting people work flexibly and use assets more productively, but strategically is investing hugely in driverless cars.</p><p name="9b96" id="9b96" class="graf--p graf-after--p">And we don’t blame <a href="https://medium.com/u/d1c584040a63" data-href="https://medium.com/u/d1c584040a63" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="d1c584040a63" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user">Travis Kalanick</a> (actually we do, but that’s not the point of this story).
