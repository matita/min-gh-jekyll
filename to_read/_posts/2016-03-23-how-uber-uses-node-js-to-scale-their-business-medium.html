To conquer the considerable challenge of ensuring a reliably excellent experience for its customers and drivers at a quickly-growing scale, Uber has built its massive matching system on Node.js.</p><p name="583c" id="583c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The three core strengths that made Node.js a particularly good fit for Uber, include:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="e8f4" id="e8f4" class="graf--li graf-after--p">Node.js handles asynchronous I/O requests with a non-blocking, single-threaded event loop. It is particularly well-suited to distributed systems that make a lot of network requests.</li><li name="f935" id="f935" class="graf--li graf-after--li">Node.js — and JavaScript in general — is excellent for quick iteration; programs can be inspected and errors can be addressed on the fly without requiring a restart, so developers can publish and deploy new code constantly.</li><li name="6903" id="6903" class="graf--li graf-after--li">The active open source community continuously optimizes the technology; it gets better, all the time, practically on its own.</li></ol><p name="216c" id="216c" class="graf--p graf-after--li">This <a href="http://bit.ly/21E6stC" data-href="http://bit.ly/21E6stC" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">case study </a>dives into all three of these points in more detail.</p><p name="f266" id="f266" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">If you want to hear more about Uber, check out Tom Croucher’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElI5QtUISWM" data-href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ElI5QtUISWM" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">presentation at Node.js Interactive</a>. Tom is a senior site reliability engineer and talks about how Node.js is being used at Uber and how future growth requires the community to push the boundaries and expectations for Node.js. Uber’s <a href="https://uber.github.io/" data-href="https://uber.github.io/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">GitHub page</a> is a good source to also learn more about the company’s most critical systems.</p></div></div></section>
