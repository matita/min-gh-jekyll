<p>The war of words between online publishers and makers of ad-blocking software has heated up in recent years. Now, a maker of&nbsp;popular ad-blocking software&nbsp;has a new project it says will help online publishers get paid.</p>
<p>Adblock Plus has joined up with Flattr to create "Flattr Plus," a system for Web users&nbsp;who want to pay online content creators.&nbsp;Flattr Plus users will set their own monthly budget that will pay&nbsp;favorite bloggers, musicians, artists, or newspapers. The payments will be apportioned&nbsp;automatically, based on a user's engagement with various websites.</p>
<p>Flattr was co-founded by a man who already knows a thing or two about running controversial Web services: Peter Sunde, who also created and operated The Pirate Bay.</p>
<p>"Our goal with Flattr Plus is to finally evolve the Web into what it was supposed to have been to begin with: a place for creators to meet their audience, and a mechanism for audiences to directly and sustainably support creators,” <a href="http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20160503005390/en/Flattr-Adblock-Collaborate-Fix-27-Year-Old-Flaw-World">said Sunde in a press release</a>.</p>
<p></p>Ben Williams, head of operations for Adblock Plus parent company Eyeo, <a href="http://www.wsj.com/articles/adblock-plus-announces-payment-tool-for-online-content-1462274323?mod=rss_whats_news_technology#:bf5-bOyLmlDaOA">told <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Wall Street Journal</em></a> that his company has been working with Flattr for "a couple of years" on the project. Eyeo has purchased a minority stake in Flattr.<p></p>
<p>Flattr&nbsp;and Adblock Plus&nbsp;will make money from&nbsp;the project by keeping a 10 percent cut of the money spent by&nbsp;Flattr Plus users. The product is still in beta testing and will be launched later this year, Williams&nbsp;<a href="http://techcrunch.com/2016/05/03/adblock-plus-teams-up-with-flattr-to-help-readers-pay-publishers/">told TechCrunch</a>.</p>
<p>Adblock Plus and its competitors fill a controversial niche&nbsp;on the Web.&nbsp;Ad-blocking software cuts off revenue&nbsp;for ad-supported publishers as the service's&nbsp;popularity has grown in recent years. Adblock Plus alone claims the software has been downloaded more than 500 million&nbsp;times.&nbsp;Some&nbsp;news sites, such as&nbsp;<em>Forbes</em>, have started preventing readers from loading its website if they have ad-blocking software installed. Others, like <em>The Guardian</em>, put up special messages for&nbsp;ad-blocking users asking them to support the site in another way.</p>
<p>Eyeo also&nbsp;rules on what are "acceptable ads," allowing them through its filters if it deems them to be not disruptive or intrusive. The company then&nbsp;takes payment from larger companies in the "acceptable ads" program,&nbsp;a practice which publishers and advertisers have complained about.</p>
<p>Williams told TechCrunch&nbsp;that users who opt out of all advertising—even the simple text ads allowed by&nbsp;ABP's "acceptable ads" program—have been "the most vocal in asking for solutions like this."</p>
