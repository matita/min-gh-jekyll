Watching a trip is a really useful tool for savvy travelers: It means they can go on living their lives while we do the heavy lifting of keeping an eye on their trips’ prices and notifying them when prices drop to our predicted low (as well as alerting them about good deals and flash sales). And for us, the feature has important engagement hooks, as users who watch a flight are much more likely to return to the app than those who do not.</p><figure name="cf87" id="cf87" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded is-imageLoaded" data-image-id="1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="658" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="40"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8Y2F5-63oHHK2T3MreaN2A.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div></figure><p name="7ce7" id="7ce7" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">But what is the ultimate point of watching and engaging with the app? Users watch trips so that they can get a good deal or the lowest price on airfare, meaning that they (usually) intend to book the flights they watch. Focusing our energy on improving the front of the flow — i.e., watching — helped <a href="http://appcues.com/academy/wow-tactics/" data-href="http://appcues.com/academy/wow-tactics/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow">reduce “our time to WOW</a>,” driving up short-term engagement and retention metrics. But these efforts only served half of our app’s use cases. Addressing the back of the flow and how users “lock in” their good prices will in time decide our long-term usefulness, retention, and “completeness” on mobile. So we set out to improve our booking handoff, or how we transition the user from shopping to buying.</p><h3 name="91de" id="91de" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Importance of Handoffs</h3><p name="9965" id="9965" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">As we mentioned in “<a href="https://medium.com/@hopper_travel/waiting-is-the-hardest-thing-b340626ff123#.dnpevbp6o" data-href="https://medium.com/@hopper_travel/waiting-is-the-hardest-thing-b340626ff123#.dnpevbp6o" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Waiting is the Hardest Thing</a>,” good flight prices are often found as a result of volatility and can change from hour to hour. This means that when Hopper sends users push notifications about prices reaching their predicted lows, they have a short and often unknown window until those prices fluctuate again. Users can lose out on a great deal if they do not act quickly, and, in a worse case scenario, pay more than if they would have just bought that flight earlier. Anything that limits the ability of the user to act decreases the chance of them locking in the prices we predict.</p><p name="0726" id="0726" class="graf--p graf-after--p">A user not getting a good price or paying more than when they started watching a trip risks the user’s overall experience buying flights. Even if this isn’t a result of the quality of our prediction and notifications — our core app features — the user is still likely to associate our product with the negative feelings of that experience. Limiting that risk became a priority, and our existing handoff limited the user’s ability to act and lock in a good deal.</p><h3 name="8c5b" id="8c5b" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Problem with Handoffs</h3><p name="d427" id="d427" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">Not unlike Kayak or Hipmunk, for example, our existing handoff linked users to a web view of the site where the prices were found (often the airline or an online travel agency). From there, the user would fill in the forms and complete the booking.</p><figure name="c00f" id="c00f" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="573" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="35"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8m_phaQFVottHx67m0iegQ.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Kayak iOS app’s booking handoff.</figcaption></figure><figure name="dd4a" id="dd4a" class="graf--figure graf-after--figure"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="573" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="35"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*ZzsYHqwJBxSXtYEoYyjhEA.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Hipmunk iOS app’s booking handoff.</figcaption></figure><p name="5f8b" id="5f8b" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">The problem with loading a web view was that the process was often slow, and by “exiting” the user from the app into the web, we lost control of the quality of the user experience on all fronts. Many airline’s websites are not optimized for mobile and are extremely frustrating to use; they increase the amount of time it takes to book on mobile (vs. on the web) and they ultimately hurt our conversion numbers, as users abandon Hopper and either never book at all or book later (on mobile or on a desktop computer) at a higher price. As a mobile-only company, the idea of users needing to leave the app and re-search for the flights on their desktops or laptops stung. Moreover, the thought of missing a deal eroded our value prop.</p><figure name="8583" id="8583" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="573" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="35"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*iAyE_3fPGSf42mUko68dVQ.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Skyscanner iOS app’s booking handoff.</figcaption></figure><p name="0df3" id="0df3" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Taking the user from the app and into the web also meant we lost out on important conversion data, such as how many users complete the process post-exiting as well as what parts of the booking funnel had higher or lower friction than others. This data could then help us create a better experience for the user overall. We were not only sending users into an unknown universe, but we were flying blind after we sent them.</p><h3 name="1976" id="1976" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Amazon’s 1-Click Ordering</h3><p name="6ced" id="6ced" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">The more we came to understand the problem we were trying to solve, the more we realized it was not just about how we build a booking engine. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Rather, it was about whether or not we could ultimately build a better way to book flights on mobile</strong>.

We were initially pleased, and then frightened, at how easy this process was.</p><p name="6be7" id="6be7" class="graf--p graf-after--p">We determined the combination of expectations set by other flight-booking engines for length and level of complexity, the lack of a significant differentiator for the blue “Pay” button from the buttons on screens immediately preceding it, and the ease of triggering its final state made our booking flow far easier than we expected&nbsp;… to a fault.</p><figure name="c988" id="c988" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="156" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="7"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*sQxnfYWy6X-Sx5zdcVMHAQ.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The primary CTA buttons in the booking flow were treated the same, and didn’t visually express the significance of the “Pay Securely Now” action.</figcaption></figure><h3 name="7265" id="7265" class="graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Context, Security, and Friction</h3><p name="7d19" id="7d19" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">Through the process of analyzing behavioral data, we also learned that we didn’t balance the bare essentials required to book a flight with the necessary level of information that would make people comfortable enough to book. We saw a lot of users jumping back and forth in the funnel, going from payment selection back to traveler information, back to trip summary, and forward again. This behavior suggested that users were going back to see information about their itineraries that they had forgotten in the process, likely fearful of losing their data when they returned. Some users dropped off the funnel completely before finishing. An unknown number of those users likely intended to book before they lost confidence and swiped back.</p><p name="e75a" id="e75a" class="graf--p graf-after--p">To address both the dangerous ease of conversion and the confidence issue, we opted to make an additional screen right after the payment step, in which a user could review all of the details of his or her flight.</p><figure name="36ed" id="36ed" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="600" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="37"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*8HmaXJwtjJYHtJ2QBEXQ8w.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The Hopper Review Details screen.</figcaption></figure><p name="70ed" id="70ed" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Here we colored the payment button green to differentiate it visually from the blue buttons previously seen in the flow, to warn the user that they were going to take a more significant action than on previous screens. We also made it a swipe, rather than tap, interaction to decrease the number of accidental taps.</p><figure name="c3ea" id="c3ea" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg" data-width="1200" data-height="156" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><canvas class="progressiveMedia-canvas js-progressiveMedia-canvas" width="75" height="7"></canvas><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*KVlHVV36tetxGBnjGvX9jw.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">The “Swipe to Pay” button was given unique visual treatment to signal importance.</figcaption></figure><p name="9b6c" id="9b6c" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">A lock icon replaced the words “securely” on the button so we could make room for the extra words associated with the swipe interaction. To set us up for the new screen, we relabeled the blue button on the prior screen to “Review Details.”</p><h3 name="9afb" id="9afb" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">Better Booking</h3><p name="131c" id="131c" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">We were nervous that this added screen and friction would lead to a 10%+ decrease in conversion, but we were pleasantly surprised to see it comfortably below that margin, with a notable decrease in the amount of back and forth we were seeing before. We’ve also started to see a lower percentage of support resources tied up on accidental bookings. Put in the context of week-over-week growth in bookings, we are super excited about what we created with QuickTap Booking in iOS and are working hard to add it to Android soon.</p><p name="ec74" id="ec74" class="graf--p graf-after--p">This process made it clear that with determination, initiative and the right team, it <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">is</em> possible to build better e-commerce flows in mobile categories that are often neglected; for us, that was flights.
