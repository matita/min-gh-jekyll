          <p>The production of this short was used to stress our beta versions of <a href="http://unity3d.com/unity/beta" class="cub">Unity 5.4</a> and the cinematic sequencer currently in development. We also used an experimental implementation of real time area lights.</p>
          <p>The demo makes extensive use of the high fidelity physics simulation tool <a href="https://www.assetstore.unity3d.com/en/#!/content/56666" class="cub">CaronteFX</a>, which is now available for Unity on the AssetStore.</p>
          <p>The Demo team also created some custom tools on top of the Unity engine to cover specific production needs. For this project we needed volumetric fog, transparency shader, motion blur â€“ to name a few. Expect to have them in your hands after Unite Europe.</p>
          <p>The demo runs at 1440p on a GTX980.</p>
