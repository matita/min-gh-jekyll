Those who were lucky enough to buy those first magical devices opened the box, turned it on, and…voila! They immediately knew how to use it and were off and running. They knew how to use a completely new product with new software and a unique user interface (UI), straight out of the box. How did Apple create such an intuitive UI? The answer, as it turns out, isn’t so intuitive.</p><blockquote name="c763" id="c763" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--p">“It’s an automatic process over which we have no control.”</blockquote><h3 name="a42e" id="a42e" class="graf--h3 graf-after--pullquote">Intuitive = Familiar</h3><p name="7e24" id="7e24" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">Dictionary.com defines something as “<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/intuitive" data-href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/intuitive" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">intuitive</a>” if you can understand it immediately, without the need for conscious reasoning. It’s an automatic process over which we have no control. This old saying explains it in starker terms: “The only intuitive interface is the nipple. Everything else is learned.” The origins of this quotation remain <a href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/misc/nipple.html" data-href="http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/misc/nipple.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">foggy</a>, and the accuracy of the statement is questionable, but the implication is clear: intuition is rooted in familiarity. What people regard as an intuitive user interface actually leans on their existing skills and knowledge from their previous experiences. This applies to products, services, and business models equally.</p><p name="9302" id="9302" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Even <a href="http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-2/mac-history/2012-02-01/how-jef-raskin-started-the-macintosh-project" data-href="http://www.mac-history.net/apple-history-2/mac-history/2012-02-01/how-jef-raskin-started-the-macintosh-project" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Jef Raskin</a>, who pioneered the Macintosh project for Apple, has <a href="http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html" data-href="http://www.asktog.com/papers/raskinintuit.html" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">equated</a> “intuitive” with “familiar.” That was Apple’s secret to the UI in its first iPhone, which felt intuitive to many people. Even before they got their hands on it, customers knew how to use the iPhone, thanks to an aggressive <a href="https://youtu.be/H_xUuf8aYEA?t=30s" data-href="https://youtu.be/H_xUuf8aYEA?t=30s" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">advertising campaign</a> that featured demonstrations of the product.

The spot featured everything from teary-eyed grandparents to children kissing their dogs, but the iPhone screen didn’t appear once in the commercial. Why? Because by then, everyone was already familiar with the iPhone. It was already intuitive.</p><h3 name="9668" id="9668" class="graf--h3 graf-after--p">The Learning Process</h3><figure name="5aee" id="5aee" class="graf--figure graf-after--h3"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg" data-width="1666" data-height="830" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*AW9-M5wreYmE2O6m5OkRiA.jpeg"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">(Windows 3.x — Solitaire and Minesweeper games)</figcaption></figure><p name="6ccd" id="6ccd" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Lets go back in time, to Windows 3.x. Microsoft added games to the operating system to train users how to use new interactions. As Jared Spool explains in his <a href="https://articles.uie.com/design_intuitive/" data-href="https://articles.uie.com/design_intuitive/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">article</a>, one of the conditions to make design familiar, is a condition where “The user is being trained, but in a way that seems natural.” Jared talks about the ‘gap’ between current and target knowlege and how training helps to bridge it. <span class="markup--quote markup--p-quote is-other" name="f0b959d060bd" data-creator-ids="3c73a5d18246">I think the motivation level of this training will excel the learning process therefor bridging the gap faster.</span> This is why Microsoft’s idea of using games to motivate people to learn these new interactions was a good one. Each game taught and trained users a specific new interaction. Solitare taught users how drag&amp;drop, Minesweeper trained users to left/right click super fast by making a game that required a user to use a lot of mental effort for the main goal, in which with practice, improved automatic motor skills.(<a href="http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?path=uk%2Ftechnology%2F32106%2Fthe-true-purpose-of-solitaire-minesweeper-hearts-and-freecell" data-href="http://m.mentalfloss.com/article.php?path=uk%2Ftechnology%2F32106%2Fthe-true-purpose-of-solitaire-minesweeper-hearts-and-freecell" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">James Hunt gives more examples about windows 3.x games, worth reading.</a>) Think about driving a car for example. First you’re thinking how to operate it, but when your focus changes to safely reaching your destination, operating the car has become automatic. When the operation of a device becomes automatic, we can surely say that it has become intuitive(familiar).</p><p name="014c" id="014c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">This is a learning process that involves a lot of practice. What Apple did with the iPhone tutorial-commercials was a learning process through “thinking,” where the user sees something new, analyzes actions, searches for suitable patterns and assesses his behaviour. If we follow the potential iPhone customer journey in 2007, we can see how Social Learning Theory formulated by Albert Bandura applies here.</p><p name="ce95" id="ce95" class="graf--p graf-after--p">The Modeling Process developed by Bandura can help to break it down. There are 4 steps in the Modeling Process:</p><ol class="postList"><li name="fe73" id="fe73" class="graf--li graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Attention</strong> - You must pay attention in order to learn from the person that demonstrates the behaviour. Think about a person in a TV commercial that demonstrates how to operate the iPhone. At this stage we have a target audience learn how to use iPhone, even though the device isn’t available in stores yet.</li><li name="955b" id="955b" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Retention</strong> - In order to retain what you’ve learned, you must to observe the behaviour again and again. With TV commercial and Apple’s budget you will surely be exposed to many observations of same demonstration.</li><li name="a905" id="a905" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Reproduction</strong> - Here you have to demonstrate what you’ve learned. A person entering the store to play(demonstrate/practice) with the iPhone he has been watching demonstration of for months on TV. Practice of the behaviour is very important to retain the new knowledge.</li><li name="0cc8" id="0cc8" class="graf--li graf-after--li"><strong class="markup--strong markup--li-strong">Motivation</strong> - Being motivated to repeat the behaviour is important to keep you practicing it. Think about iPhone owners that demonstrating the newly bought device to their friends and being rewarded by the positive attention.</li></ol><figure name="28fd" id="28fd" class="graf--figure graf-after--li"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png" data-width="1666" data-height="830" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*K0zOvz7KcjR6eHXZZC-Fww.png"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">(“This is how to turn the iPhone ON” —<a href="https://youtu.be/6lZMr-ZfoE4" data-href="https://youtu.be/6lZMr-ZfoE4" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor"> iPhone 2007 commercia</a>l)</figcaption></figure><h3 name="389c" id="389c" class="graf--h3 graf-after--figure">Unique UI</h3><p name="eef3" id="eef3" class="graf--p graf-after--h3">User experience (UX) designers are often at odds with corporate decision makers about what makes a great UX. At design meetings, the word “intuitive” gets thrown around countless times in close proximity to the words “Apple” and “iPhone.” What many of the corporate suits miss is that if you want to create the next great UX, your UI can’t just be intuitive in terms of familiarity. You must identify the core of your product or service and find a unique, simple interface for it.</p><figure name="1672" id="1672" class="graf--figure graf-after--p"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder is-locked"><div class="aspectRatioPlaceholder-fill"></div><div class="progressiveMedia js-progressiveMedia graf-image is-canvasLoaded" data-image-id="1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png" data-width="895" data-height="660" data-action="zoom" data-action-value="1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png" data-scroll="native"><img src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/freeze/max/30/1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png?q=20" crossorigin="anonymous" class="progressiveMedia-thumbnail js-progressiveMedia-thumbnail"><img class="progressiveMedia-image js-progressiveMedia-image" data-src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png"><noscript class="js-progressiveMedia-inner">&lt;img class="progressiveMedia-noscript js-progressiveMedia-inner" src="https://cdn-images-2.medium.com/max/800/1*pMYE6xqw-IbHhZ-_Yyihvw.png"&gt;</noscript></div></div><figcaption class="imageCaption">(Unique and Easy to Use music-app by Propellerhead — <a href="https://www.propellerheads.se/figure" data-href="https://www.propellerheads.se/figure" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor">FIGURE</a>)</figcaption></figure><p name="2d99" id="2d99" class="graf--p graf-after--figure">Once you have unique core elements and processes in place, the rest of the product will become intuitive.

But an MVP is merely a learning tool; it’s something you use to research the market, not a finished consumer product. To reach the masses quickly, you need to define an <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">initial product</em> that’s flashy enough to get people talking, but simple enough to learn easily.</p><p name="cbaa" id="cbaa" class="graf--p graf-after--p">Your initial product definition should address every major aspect of the product, such as performance, quality, marketing features, and overall user experience. The first iPhone wasn’t an MVP, it was an initial product that evolved over time.

So if you want your users to have new experiences you need to create something unique, but you can’t abandon the intuitive and the familiar altogether. Intuitive doesn’t mean old and worn. There are plenty of perfectly good, proven design patterns you can use to make your application look familiar right away. These patterns can help bridge the “gap” between current and target knowledge. Therefore I suggest a hybrid approach that combines familiar features to give users a basis on which to start exploring your application, and then build on those to introduce new, unique features that set you apart from the competition. Finding the right balance between the familiar and the unique is part art and part science. Objective testing methods can help you find the right balance.</p><p name="4b07" id="4b07" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">When it comes to UX, a little “wow” goes a long way.</p></div></div></section><section name="69b2" class=" section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="a20f" id="a20f" class="graf--p graf--first"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">I am David Ismailov,<br></strong>Follow me on <a href="https://twitter.com/dima_david" data-href="https://twitter.com/dima_david" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Twitter</strong></a> and/or <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/dimadavid" data-href="https://linkedin.com/in/dimadavid" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="nofollow"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">LinkedIn</strong></a></p><p name="6e8c" id="6e8c" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">(Help others to find my article on Medium by giving it a ♥ below )</p></div></div></section>
