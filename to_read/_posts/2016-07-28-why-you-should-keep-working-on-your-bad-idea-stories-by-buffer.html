Good ideas come through iteration</h3><blockquote name="c1fa" id="c1fa" class="graf--pullquote pullquote graf--startsWithDoubleQuote graf-after--h3"><em class="markup--em markup--pullquote-em">“real startups tend to discover the problem they’re solving by a process of evolution.

I think that this is actually the norm rather than the exception.

At the same time, this means that further iteration can also lead to the exact opposite: uncovering an idea or features which people want and will gain traction.</p><p name="e0af" id="e0af" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Have you ever given up on something and feel in hindsight it would have been better to continue?
