			<p>You may have seen the <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-08/for-your-next-flight-hope-the-tsa-randomizer-puts-you-in-a-faster-lane">TSA Randomizer</a> on your last flight. A TSA agent
holds an iPad. The agent taps the iPad, a large arrow points right or left, and
you follow it into a given lane.</p>
<p>How much does the TSA pay for an app that a beginner could build in a day? It
turns out the TSA paid IBM $1.4 million dollars for it.</p>


<p>It's not hard! I searched on Google for "TSA FOIA" and found this page, which
describes exactly how to reach the FOIA team at the TSA. Ignore the part about
how they will get back to you in 20 days. I sent them this email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I request that a copy of documents concerning the following subject
matter be provided to me:</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The RFP (Request for Proposal) issued by the TSA for designing and
implementing the "TSA Randomizer" iPad application, described <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-05-08/for-your-next-flight-hope-the-tsa-randomizer-puts-you-in-a-faster-lane">here</a>
and currently in use by TSA agents at security checkpoints at many airports,
including Terminal 2 at Oakland International Airport.</p>
<p>Details of any submitted bids from contractors or internal
government agencies to design and construct the "TSA Randomizer" iPad
app.</p>
<p>The final signed contract between the TSA and a contractor to
implement the "TSA Randomizer" iPad app.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I also included a little bit about how I thought this request should be
eligible for a fee waiver, and how I wasn't going to profit from knowing this
information, but it didn't seem particularly difficult to get the data, so I'm
not sure it mattered.</p>
<p>They just got back to me! They sent me two documents. The first
is <a href="https://kev.inburke.com/tsa/response-letter.pdf">a disclaimer about how they had to black out some of the
information</a>. The second is <a href="https://kev.inburke.com/tsa/contract.pdf">the contract between the TSA and
IBM</a>. And there's the payment:</p>
<p>Later today <a href="https://twitter.com/pratheekrebala">Pratheek Rebala</a> reached out to mention that this data
is available publicly, and there were <a href="https://www.usaspending.gov/Transparency/Pages/AwardSummary.aspx?AwardID=9787668">8 other payments as part of the same
award</a>, totaling $1.4 million; the document I have is one part, totaling
$336,000. Furthermore, there were 4 bids for the contract and IBM won the
bidding.</p>


<p>Unfortunately we don't know everything the TSA got for that $1.4 million. They
might have just gotten the iPad app; they might have gotten iPads, or work
on multiple different apps, including the TSA Randomizer. We only know it's
associated with the TSA Randomizer based on the FOIA request that returned this
document.</p>

<p>I should mention that the Obama Administration, the "most transparent", has
<a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/obama-administration-sets-new-record-withholding-foia-requests/">set numerous records for delays in turning over files and refusing to fulfill
requests for access</a>, and none of the candidates seem likely to
reverse that trend. If you think this is important, consider writing your
elected officials and asking them to prioritize this, or making decisions in
November based on this.</p>
