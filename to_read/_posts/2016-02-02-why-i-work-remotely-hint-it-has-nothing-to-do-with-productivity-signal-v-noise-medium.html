I do my best (and sometimes it’s really hard) to stop what I’m doing, turn to him and be present. How many more of those conversations will there be? I’ll take every one I can get.</p><p name="ba2c" id="ba2c" class="graf--p graf-after--p">My daughter comes home <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">starving</em>. Taking 10 minutes to make her a snack makes both of our days. She could totally do it herself and I could totally keep working but which 10 minutes am I going to remember? Which will she remember?</p><p name="77d7" id="77d7" class="graf--p graf-after--p graf--last">If you have little kids (or no kids) what I’m experiencing may seem like it’s irrelevant (or at least a long way off) but I promise you it’s not. You won’t remember working a little later or catching up on Saturday because the people you love interrupted you but you’re certain to remember those little interactions. And even more, they will remember them, too. <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">This</em> is why I work remotely. I worked a day job and freelanced all night (while putting myself through college) when these same kids were little. I barely remember those years. Be grateful that you’re home to be interrupted at all.</p></div></div></section><section name="4a12" class=" section--body"><div class="section-divider layoutSingleColumn"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner layoutSingleColumn"><p name="d705" id="d705" class="graf--p graf--first">Today’s American worker is the most productive in the world and our productivity has increased exponentially for more than a century.</p><blockquote name="7170" id="7170" class="graf--blockquote graf-after--p">An average worker needs to work a mere 11 hours per week to produce as much as one working 40 hours per week in 1950.
